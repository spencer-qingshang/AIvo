**什么是短语、从句？**

一个词就是单词，两个及以上单词构成的就叫做短语

一个以上单词构成且含有主语和谓语的就叫做从句。

- 单词

- apple,you,eat,beautiful,very

- 短语

- the big apple,a very beautiful girl,because of you.

- 从句

- because I love you,that I love you,who I will love forever.

**简单复习下名词：**

- 简单的

- love

- friedship

- book

- pencil

- 中等长度

- 喜爱的东西

- 唱的歌

- 读的东西

- 动名词和动词不定式

- to love = loving

- to sing = singing

- to read = reading

- to study = studying

# that

- 在主谓宾或主谓表等完整结构前加that便构成了名词性从句

- 我爱你的事

- that I love you.

- 她聪明的事

- that she is smart.

- 她是教师的事

- that she is a teacher.

- 名词性从句具有名词性质，所以也可以作主宾补

- 主语

- That Shrek married Princess Fiona is true.

- 宾语

- I know that Shrek married Pricess Fiona.

- 补语

- The important thing is that Shrek married Princess Fiona.

- 遇到很长的句子时，用括号或下划线标示出主要成分，这样句子就变得简单，容易理解了

- （That she is a teacher) is true.

- I know (that she is a teacher).

- The important thing is (that she is a teacher)

- 在用that引导的名词性从句作主语时，英语为了避免头重脚轻会使用形式主语，并把真正主语放后面，与动词不定式和动名词作名词性用法的做法一样。

- That Shrek married Princess Fiona is true.

- It is true that Shrek married Princess Fiona.

- That she is a teacher is true.

- It is true that she is a teacher.

- 准确判断名词性从句在句子中作主宾补哪一成分，才能正确翻译

- It is true that shrek married princess Fiona.

- 作主语

- 这里的taht可以省略，但是不用形式主语时则不能省略

- I know that shrek married princess Fiona.

- 作宾语

- 这里的that可以省略

- The important thing is that shrek married princess Fiona.

- 作补语

- 这里的that可以省略

- 从属连词

- I know that Shrek married Pricess Fiona

- 我知道史莱克和菲奥娜公主结婚了

- 没必要说我知道，因为不自然也不简炼

- Shrek married Pricess Fina 从属与 I know充当宾语作用，同时起到链接的作用，等同于and

# if/whether

构成是否.....的名词性从句

- 主语

- 我是否爱你是个问题

- whether/if I love you.

- 宾语

- 你知道我是否爱你

- You know wherther I love you.

- 补语

- 问题是我是否爱你

- The problem is whether/if I love you.

- if和whether有什么区别

- 作宾语和补语是没有区别，作主语时只能用whether，为了和虚拟语气作区分。

- Whether Shrek married Princess Fiona or not is important.

- It is important whether Shrek married Princess Fiona (or not).

- 当用了形式主语的形式，wherther就可以换成if，因为主语放后面去了，不会和虚拟语气混淆

- I wonder whether Shrek married Princess Fiona or not.

- The important thing is whether Shrek married Princess Fiona or not.

# 间接疑问句

- 直接疑问句

- Do you love me?

- It is cold?

- Do you go now ?

- who are you?

- what is this?

- when do you sleep?

- where do you come from?

- where does he live?

- 间接疑问句

- 比起直接疑问句的表达会更加委婉和柔和

- 能对我说是否爱我吗？能告诉我这是什么吗？

- 能告诉我你现在冷不冷吗？能告诉我你什么时候睡觉吗？

- 能告诉我你是谁吗？能告诉我他住在哪吗？

- 不含特殊疑问词的间接疑问句

- Can you tell me whether you love me?

- Can you tell me whether it is cold?

- Can you tell me whether you go now?

- 含有特殊疑问词的间接疑问句

- Can you tell me who you are?

- who you are，这是特殊疑问词从句

- Do you know what it is?

- 为什么是特殊疑问句+主语+谓语的语序呢？

- 因为是陈述语气，实义动词也不需要借用助动词

- 具备名词性质，可以作主宾补

- Do you konw who she is?

- Who she is not important.

- I don't know who she is.

- The important thing is who she is.

- Who she is is not important.

- 两个is也是正确的，第一个is是从句的谓语，第二个is是主句的谓语

- 特殊疑问代词同时起疑问代词和主语时，可以直接用“特殊疑问词+谓语”的形式

- Do you know who said so?

- 这里的who既做主语也做疑问代词
