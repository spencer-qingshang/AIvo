When did you become a weather forecaster?

您是什么时候成为天气预报员的？

**Matt Taylor:**

**马特·泰勒：**

I joined the BBC Weather Centre in June 1992 and did my first live broadcast about six months later.

我于1992年6月加入了BBC天气中心，大约六个月后进行了我的第一次现场直播。

**Interviewer:**

**采访者：**

Why did you want to be a weather forecaster?

您为什么想成为一名天气预报员？

**Matt Taylor:**

**马特·泰勒：**

I am passionate about the weather, and the challenge of presenting weather information to the public, especially in times of severe weather, in a coherent and pleasant style, was the principal motivation.

我对天气充满热情，同时也喜欢向公众传递天气信息的挑战，尤其是在恶劣天气时，用一种连贯且愉快的方式呈现信息，这是我最主要的动力。

**Interviewer:**

**采访者：**

Do you get nervous before a broadcast?

在直播前您会紧张吗？

**Matt Taylor:**

**马特·泰勒：**

I do, but not as much as in the early days! If the forecast is complicated, then I do get nervous about whether I will present it well and effectively, as I want to do a good job. If I think there is a lot to say, I sometimes speak too fast, which makes me nervous, so I do exercises to calm myself down.

会的，但没有刚开始时那么紧张了！如果天气预报比较复杂，我确实会担心自己能否很好地、有效地呈现出来，因为我希望把工作做好。如果我觉得要讲的内容很多，有时会说得太快，这会让我感到紧张，所以我会做一些放松的练习来让自己冷静下来。

**Interviewer:**

**采访者：**

Have you ever made any mistakes?

您犯过错误吗？

**Matt Taylor:**

**马特·泰勒：**

Yes, meteorology is a complex science. It's important to know what elements of the forecast are subject to error. Often I find making mistakes is a good way to learn, and you don’t make the same mistake twice.

有的，气象学是一门复杂的科学。重要的是要知道哪些预报内容可能会出错。我经常发现犯错误是学习的好方法，而且你不会再犯同样的错误。

**Interviewer:**

**采访者：**

Is your job hard?

您的工作难吗？

**Matt Taylor:**

**马特·泰勒：**

I would say challenging rather than hard. I feel when you've got it, you've got it. There is a lot of information to absorb in a relatively short period of time — that is probably the hardest part.

我会说是有挑战性的，而不是难。我觉得一旦掌握了，就没问题了。不过，在相对较短的时间内吸收大量信息可能是最难的部分。

**Interviewer:**

**采访者：**

Do you enjoy your job?

您喜欢您的工作吗？

**Matt Taylor:**

**马特·泰勒：**

Yes. It's exciting and challenging. The British weather is always changing, and is never the same two days running. I consider myself lucky to have found a job which is enjoyable and utilizes my physics degree.

是的。这份工作既令人兴奋又充满挑战。英国的天气总是在变化，没有两天是完全一样的。我觉得自己很幸运能找到一份既有趣又能运用我的物理学学位的工作。

**Interviewer:**

**采访者：**

What job would you do if you were not a TV weather forecaster?

如果您不是一名电视天气预报员，您会从事什么工作？

**Matt Taylor:**

**马特·泰勒：**

I don't know. But having been brought up in the countryside, I would like a job which allowed me to be out in the fresh air as much as possible.

我不知道。不过，由于我是在乡村长大的，我希望能从事一份可以尽可能多待在户外、呼吸新鲜空气的工作。

**Overnight into the 16th September 2004 we saw the winds strengthen over the northwest of the U.K.**

**2004年9月16日凌晨，英国西北部的风力增强。**

Those mighty winds pulled in a bank of cloud and some patchy rain through the small hours and into the first part of the morning.

这些强劲的风带来了大片云层，并在凌晨时分和清晨的第一段时间里伴随着零星小雨。

It was a different story in the southeast of the U.K., clearer skies and much lighter winds allowed temperatures to drop well into single figures, resulting in a touch of ground frost in some rural areas.

英国东南部的情况则截然不同，晴朗的天空和更加微弱的风使得气温大幅下降到个位数，一些乡村地区甚至出现了轻微的地面霜冻。

Redhill Airport is a notorious cold spot and here we even saw a slight air frost as temperatures dipped down to 0°C for a short time early in the morning.

雷德希尔机场是一个出了名的寒冷地带，这里清晨短时间内气温甚至降到了0°C，出现了轻微的空气霜冻。

For the bulk of the day, England and Wales were dry and bright with the early sunshine giving way to a bit more cloud through the afternoon as the winds picked up a little.

白天的大部分时间里，英格兰和威尔士的天气干燥而明亮，清晨的阳光在下午逐渐被少量云层取代，同时风力略有增强。

Most places had a fine day with some sunshine, with Norfolk seeing the lion's share with 11 full hours' worth.

大多数地方都经历了一个晴朗的好天气，其中诺福克享受了最多的阳光，总计达11个小时。

The highest temperature was to be found in Kent where 20°C was recorded.

当天的最高气温出现在肯特郡，达到了20°C。

Things were very different for Northern Ireland and Scotland.

然而，北爱尔兰和苏格兰的情况却截然不同。

After the light and patchy rain through the early hours of the morning, there was something of a drier interlude before an active weather system moved in from the west.

在清晨零星小雨过后，天气短暂转为较为干燥，但随后来自西部的活跃天气系统到来。

This brought some heavy rain and strong winds with it.

这带来了强降雨和大风。

Some of the more exposed locations saw sustained winds of 40mph with gusts of 58mph.

一些暴露在外的地区经历了持续风速为40英里/小时、阵风高达58英里/小时的强风。

Temperatures struggled in the wet and windy conditions, and Shetland saw the lowest daytime temperature of 13°C.

在湿冷多风的条件下，气温始终较低，设得兰群岛的白天最低气温仅为13°C。

The wettest place turned out to be Dumfries where 16mm of rain was collected and while it was wet for much of the day, the majority of that fell during the late afternoon.

当天降雨量最大的地方是邓弗里斯，这里的降雨量达到了16毫米。虽然大部分时间都在下雨，但主要降雨集中在下午晚些时候。

Through the evening, the rain cleared away from Northern Ireland and most of Scotland and the winds began to ease.

到了晚上，北爱尔兰和苏格兰大部分地区的降雨逐渐停止，风力也开始减弱。

At the same time, the wind and rain settled in over Northern England, Wales, and the southwest of England.

与此同时，风雨开始在英格兰北部、威尔士和英格兰西南部地区停留。

There was a real sense of autumn about the weather on Monday the 13th of September. 

9月13日星期一的天气真正带来了秋天的气息。

During the early hours, a band of showery rain swept across the U.K., and the clearing skies meant a cold start to the day for Northern Ireland, which saw temperatures fall back to 6 Celsius.

凌晨时分，一股阵雨带横扫英国，天空转晴导致北爱尔兰清晨气温骤降至6摄氏度。

During the morning, the rain quickly cleared away from southeast England.

上午，雨势很快从英格兰东南部消退。

However, it did leave behind a legacy of blustery showers.

不过，这场雨过后留下了阵阵强劲的阵雨。

During the day, these showers became heavy and thundery at times, particularly across the southern half of England and Wales.

白天，这些阵雨在英格兰南部和威尔士地区时而变得猛烈，并伴有雷暴。

Oxford was the wettest place at least until 18:00 GMT.

截至格林尼治时间18:00，牛津是降雨量最大的地方。

Here, 50mm of rain was recorded.

这里记录到50毫米的降雨。

During the afternoon and evening, the showers gradually grouped together to produce longer spells of rain, particularly across Northern Ireland and Scotland.

下午和傍晚时分，阵雨逐渐汇集成持续性降雨，特别是在北爱尔兰和苏格兰地区。

The weather faired much better at the other end of the U.K.

在英国的另一端，天气则好得多。

Plymouth basked in 9 hours of sunshine, which lifted the temperature to a respectable 19 Celsius.

普利茅斯享受了9小时的日照，气温攀升至令人舒适的19摄氏度。

Showers did eventually gather across the southwest too, but the heaviest of these arrived after dusk.

阵雨最终也抵达西南部地区，但最强的降雨要等到日落后才来临。

In fact, there were quite a crop of showers by the evening and also some very strong winds.

实际上，到了晚上，阵雨大量出现，同时还伴有强劲的大风。

Later on, the winds began gusting to gale force in some exposed spots, leading to some rather unpleasant conditions for many western and southern parts of England and Wales.

随后，一些暴露地区的风力增强到了大风级别，导致英格兰和威尔士的许多西部和南部地区天气变得相当恶劣。

**第一部分：**

Weather and climate affect the wealth of a country.

天气和气候会影响一个国家的财富。

Where the climate is too inhospitable to grow much food, or for farmers to raise livestock, a country may have to import much of its foodstuffs.

如果一个国家的气候过于恶劣，不适合种植足够的粮食，或者不适合农民饲养牲畜，那么这个国家可能不得不进口大部分食品。

If they have no other sources of natural wealth, such as mining or petroleum, they may be restricted in their growth.

如果他们没有其他自然财富来源，比如采矿或石油，他们的经济增长可能会受到限制。

Countries where there is regular drought may be subject to famine and disease if the economy is not managed properly and valuable resources are exported rather than re-invested.

那些经常遭遇干旱的国家，如果经济管理不当，且宝贵的资源被出口而非再投资，可能会面临饥荒和疾病的威胁。

Many developing countries rely on growing "cash crops" which they can export and this may limit the amount of self-sufficiency they can maintain in a time of crisis.

许多发展中国家依赖种植“经济作物”用于出口，但这可能限制它们在危机时期保持自给自足的能力。

Countries with good climates for agriculture can both feed their people and export the surplus, growing rich enough to diversify into other types of work.

而那些气候适宜农业的国家，既能养活自己的人民，又能出口剩余的农产品，从而变得足够富裕，可以多元化发展其他类型的产业。

**第二部分：**

Every year, we hear about natural disasters and "acts of God" which wipe out crops, sometimes entire harvests, and cause millions of pounds of damage.

每年，我们都会听到自然灾害或所谓的“天灾”摧毁庄稼，有时甚至毁掉整季的收成，造成数百万英镑的损失。

Many weather events have the power to do this.

许多天气事件都有这样的破坏力。

Storms, hail, extreme cold, extreme heat, and flooding can all kill crops and animals — as well as people.

暴风雨、冰雹、极寒、极热和洪水都可能杀死农作物、牲畜，甚至危及人类生命。

Indirectly, weather events can also cause disease, a rise in pest populations, bushfires, and some say even civil disturbances and riots.

间接地，天气事件还可能引发疾病、害虫数量激增、丛林大火，甚至有人认为会导致社会动荡和骚乱。

The stock market has trading on future harvests and periods of natural disaster may cause the market to fluctuate wildly.

股票市场中有关于未来收成的交易，自然灾害期间可能导致市场剧烈波动。

Insurance companies may suffer losses of billions of pounds, also destabilizing certain industries as their losses and premiums mount up.

保险公司可能因此遭受数十亿英镑的损失，这也会使某些行业陷入不稳定，因为它们的损失和保费不断增加。

Delays and penalties to international trade, construction work and manufacturing can also be affected greatly by weather events.

国际贸易、建筑工程和制造业的延误和罚款也可能因天气事件而受到严重影响。
