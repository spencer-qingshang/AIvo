Tourist: Excuse me ... I'm trying to locate the Tourist Information Center. The hotel clerk said it was about five blocks this side of the Center of town, but I've been walking for quite a while now and can't seem to find it.

游客：打扰一下……我在找旅游信息中心。酒店前台说是在市中心这边大约五个街区的地方，但我已经走了好一阵了，还是找不到。

Passerby: You just haven't walked far enough yet. It's about a ten-minute walk from here, I'd say.

路人：你只是走得不够远。从这里大概还要再走十分钟。

Tourist: Would you mind drawing me a little map on this piece of paper? I always seem to get lost when I try to follow directions.

游客：能请您在这张纸上画个简单地图吗？我按口头指路总是迷路。

Passerby: Yes, it is easier to follow a map. Okay ... You go straight along this avenue for about 200 yards; then when you come to this bend in the road, turn right.

路人：确实看地图更方便。好的……你沿着这条大道直走大约200码，当看到道路这个弯道时右转。

Tourist: Is there any landmark at that bend?

游客：转弯处有什么地标吗？

Passerby: Let me think ... yes, there's a Shell station on the left, across the street. Then after you turn, just walk for another five or six minutes. You'll see a big sign. You can't miss it.

路人：让我想想……有的，街对面左边有个壳牌加油站。转弯后继续走五六分钟，就能看到醒目的指示牌，你不会找不到的。

Hello, I'm May Hunter. I'm at a travel exhibition in Manchester, England.

大家好，我是梅·亨特。此刻我正在英国曼彻斯特参加旅游展览会。

Manchester is a fantastic place! It's full of life, lots to see and do in the evenings.

曼彻斯特真是个奇妙的地方！这里充满活力，夜生活丰富多彩。

Yesterday was my first day. I checked in at the hotel and then went out to Chinatown, which has some great Chinese restaurants and things to see.

昨天是我抵达的第一天，办理酒店入住后就去了唐人街——那里不仅有地道的中餐馆，还有许多值得一看的景致。

I love that kind of atmosphere and the wonderful Chinese supermarkets and clothes shops. I want to go back there later to do some shopping.

我特别喜欢那里的氛围，琳琅满目的中国超市和服饰店让人流连忘返，打算过几天再去好好采购一番。

In the end, I found a restaurant which had more than 50 special dishes.

与展会经理交流时得知，我们公司的展位位置优越，紧邻咖啡店和面包店。

So I should get lots of people passing and buying my holidays and tours.

Things are going well! I set out our brochures ready for the official opening, and then I went to look at the other stands.

This afternoon I want to go out again to do some shopping. I bought some presents for my boyfriend.
