Among the oldest known festivals, harvest feasts have existed for thousands of years.

在已知最古老的节日中，丰收盛宴已经存在了数千年。

Ancient peoples offered the year's first ripe grains to the gods in thanks for the crops that would sustain their communities for the coming year.

古代人民将当年最早成熟的谷物献给神灵，以感恩这些将在来年养育他们社区的作物。

In autumn, after farmers had reaped all of their harvest, they hosted a "harvest home" feast for members of their community.

秋天，农民们收割完所有庄稼后，会为社区成员举办一场“丰收之家”的盛宴。

Customarily, participants in the feast would make a corn dolly, a symbolic or decorative figure made of straw.

按照习俗，盛宴的参与者会制作一个玉米稻草人，即用稻草制作的象征性或装饰性人偶。

People believed that the dolly contained the spirit of a successful harvest, so when the feasting had ended, they took the dolly to a farmhouse where they stored it until the next harvest supper.

人们相信，这个稻草人包含了成功丰收的精神，所以当盛宴结束后，他们会将其带到农舍保存，直至下一次丰收晚宴。

如今，在英语世界中，人们将庆祝丰收之家节作为一种非官方的宗教节日，通常在九月下旬或十月初的某个星期天举行。

Since the mid-19th century, it has become customary during the Harvest Home festival to decorate churches with fruit and vegetables.
