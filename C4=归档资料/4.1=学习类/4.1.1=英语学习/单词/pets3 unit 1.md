Parents. And here are Mom and Dad, and here’s my older brother, Lester, again with his wife and three of their children: Nicolas, Ryan, and Laura. Ryan really has an outgoing personality. See how he’s smiling?


Yes. He looks like he’s fun to be with. You know what? I can see a strong family resemblance. Oh, who’s this?


That’s Curtis Lane, Lester’s brother-in-law, his wife’s brother. You ought to meet this man. He really knows how to bring a person out. I wish I had his social skills.


Who’s this lady with Curtis Lane?


That’s his and Dorothy’s mother, Lester’s mother-in-law, Mrs. Lane.


Does Mrs. Lane live with Lester and Dorothy?


Oh, no! Lester always said he would never live with his in-laws. Well, Layth, since we’ve looked at all the pictures, would you like to go out and stretch your legs?


Okay! That’s a good idea. But I enjoyed looking at the pictures.

这是我的父母。这是爸爸和妈妈，还有我哥哥莱斯特。他和妻子以及他们的三个孩子——尼古拉斯、瑞安和劳拉——都在这张照片里。瑞安特别外向。你看他笑得多开心！


是啊，他看起来是个很有趣的人。你知道吗？我觉得你们家人长得真的很像。哦，这个人是谁？


这是柯蒂斯·莱恩，莱斯特的内兄，也就是他妻子的哥哥。你一定得认识一下这个人，他特别擅长让人放松、打开话匣子。我真希望自己也有他那样的社交能力。


跟柯蒂斯·莱恩在一起的这位女士是谁？


那是他的母亲，也就是多萝西的母亲，莱斯特的岳母——莱恩夫人。


莱恩夫人和莱斯特、多萝西住在一起吗？


哦，当然没有！莱斯特总是说他绝不会和岳父母住在一起。对了，莱斯，我们已经看完所有的照片了，你想出去走走吗？


好啊！这是个不错的主意。不过我真的很喜欢看这些照片。

Mary was an eighteen-year-old girl.

玛丽是个十八岁的女孩。

She was only five feet two inches tall and 105 pounds heavy.

她身高只有1米57，体重才47.6公斤。

When she was offered a job of a store detective, she felt surprised.

当她被通知可以当商店侦探时，她感到非常意外。

The manager explained that they just needed persons like Mary for she didn't look like a detective.

经理解释说，他们正需要像玛丽这样的人，因为她看起来一点也不像侦探。

He said, "Most shoplifters are well-dressed, and many of them have much money and good jobs."

他说：“大多数小偷穿得都很体面，而且很多人不仅有钱，还有不错的工作。”

The manager was right.

经理果然说得没错。

One morning, Mary saw someone who looked like a businessman standing at the tie counter.

一天早上，玛丽看到一个看起来像商人的人站在领带柜台前。

The salesclerk showed the man expensive silk ties.

售货员正在给他展示昂贵的真丝领带。

Then the clerk went to help another customer.

随后，售货员转身去招呼另一位顾客。

As soon as the clerk turned around, the man put three ties in his briefcase.

就在售货员转身的瞬间，那人迅速把三条领带塞进了自己的公文包。

Two minutes later when the clerk turned, the man said, "I don't like these silk ties. They aren't of good quality."

两分钟后，当售货员转回来时，那人却说道：“我不喜欢这些真丝领带，它们的质量不怎么样。”

The man walked as quickly as possible out of the front door.

那人尽快地走出了店门。

Mary followed him.

玛丽悄悄跟在他后面。

When the man was about to step on a magnificent Rolls-Royce, Mary went up to him and said, "Excuse me, sir, would you mind letting me take a look in your briefcase?"

当那人正准备上他那辆豪华的劳斯莱斯时，玛丽走上前说道：“打扰了，先生，能让我检查一下您的公文包吗？”

The man was seized with terror but soon he calmed down and said, "I'm afraid I certainly do mind, if it's all the same to you. Now go away."

那人先是吓得脸色发白，但很快镇定下来，说道：“抱歉，我不觉得这有什么必要。如果您没什么别的事，就请离开吧。”

Mary produced her identity card indicating that she was a store detective and she insisted on having a look into the man's briefcase.

玛丽掏出了自己的身份证，表明她是一名商店侦探，并坚持要检查他的公文包。

The man had no way out, saying, "Oh, very well. Anything to help a woman detective."

那人无计可施，只好说道：“哦，好吧。能为一位女侦探效劳，当然没问题。”

Mary took out from the briefcase three silk ties.

玛丽从他的公文包里拿出了三条真丝领带。

"Can you explain?" Mary asked.

“您能解释一下吗？”玛丽问他。

"Yes, nothing unusual in that," the man said.

“当然，这没什么特别的，”那人说道。

"I'll go to attend respectively a negotiation, a wedding and a funeral. I like to wear differently colored ties on different occasions."

“我接下来要分别去参加一场谈判、一场婚礼和一场葬礼。我喜欢在不同场合佩戴不同颜色的领带。”

Jules Verne was not an inventor and he was not a scientist, but he read a great many scientific books. He had a very strong imagination and he loved adventure although he did not have many great adventures himself. He wrote a number of exciting books about the things which he thought that scientists and inventors would one day be able to do. At the time, his stories seemed like fairy stories!

Many of Jules Verne's attempts to look into the future, however, were surprisingly accurate. For example, one book was called 

In all his books Jules Verne used his scientific knowledge as well as his imagination in describing future inventions. Sometimes he was wrong, of course, but often the accuracy of his descriptions is very surprising.

The circumstances surrounding the birth of a female infant in Kosciusko, Mississippi, on Jan. 29, 1954, were not promising. Present was the usual mix that had so often accumulated into a burden too heavy for a single-parent household like the one Oprah Winfrey grew up in. The state in which she was born had laws in place waiting to characterize her as unwelcome, to bar her participation in otherwise acceptable social activities, to shackle her to the residue of slavery and other injustices of the past. The simple truth is that her grandmother, her great-grandmother and all the great-great-grandmothers before them never experienced one day of life free from the harsh decrees of state-sponsored racial repression.

In hindsight, it appears that her birth was an uneventful one. But at age three she was reciting speeches from church pulpits. Upon discovering books, the child delved into the written word, turning out weekly book reports for her father. Even during turbulent times, not a moment was wasted. Seeds were being planted, watered, and nurtured. On April 13, 1964, nearly an adolescent and watching television from the linoleum floor of her mother's walk-up flat in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, she witnessed an event that connected to something deep inside of her. She was watching the live broadcast of the Academy Awards ceremony and saw a young African-American actor receiving the film industry's highest honor. Sharing in that moment and all it implied, she later told me, caused her to say softly to herself, "If he can do that, I wonder what I could do?"

The ground had been set. The journey of Oprah Winfrey had begun. The babe, the child, the adolescent, the young woman — all their strengths were harnessed into a force of astonishing power that placed itself in the service of nature and the human family. That the world has changed in meaningful ways since 1954 is beyond question. Oprah and her activities were driving forces in many of those changes. Her enormously influential talk show, her philanthropic work with children in Africa and elsewhere, her popular book club and magazine, her empowering spiritual message, her contribution (by action and example) to improving race relations — all speak to the human family, touching hearts and leaving each one uplifted.

Mississippi too seems to be mellowing out into a more congenial place than it was in 1954. That may also be partly due to the very special energy that is Oprah Winfrey — a courageous, funny, compassionate, well-informed, dazzlingly curious person, as down-to-earth and loving as any human being I've ever known.
