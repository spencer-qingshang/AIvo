**Jean:**

Waiter!

服务员！

**Waiter:**

Yes.

在呢。

**Jean:**

I hate to say it, but this leg of lamb is inedible. It is so fatty. In fact, it's the worst I've ever eaten!

我不想抱怨，但这块羊腿真是不能吃，太油腻了！事实上，这是我吃过最差的！

**Waiter:**

Nobody else has complained.

其他人都没抱怨过啊。

**Jean:**

I don't care if nobody else has complained. I'm telling you this is no good.

我不管别人有没有抱怨，我告诉你，这东西不好！

**Waiter:**

Okay. Do you want me to get you something else?

好的，那您需要我给您换点别的吗？

**Jean:**

No. Listen, I hate to complain, but the service here is terrible! Look, I have a ticket for the circus tonight. I'm in a hurry, but my meal took at least one hour to come. I was just kept waiting and waiting and no one told me what had happened to my order.

不需要。听着，我不想抱怨，但你们的服务真是太差了！你看，我今天晚上还要去看马戏团的演出，我赶时间，但我的菜足足等了一个小时才上来。我一直在等，没有人告诉我我的订单到底出了什么问题。

**Waiter:**

Sorry, ma'am, we're busy tonight.

抱歉，女士，今天晚上我们很忙。

**Jean:**

So I had to wait an hour, eh?

所以我就得等一个小时，是吗？

**Waiter:**

By no means, ma'am.

当然不是，女士。

**Jean:**

One of my friends recommended this place to me. He told me how good your restaurant is and how delicious your roast duck is. Is all this what I'm here for? This is outrageous!

我的一个朋友推荐了这家店，他跟我说你们的餐厅多么棒，烤鸭多么好吃。结果我来这里就是为了这个？真是太离谱了！

**Waiter:**

I'm terribly sorry, ma'am. Oh, why don't you talk to the chef? He's over there.

非常抱歉，女士。哦，要不您去跟厨师谈谈？他就在那边。

**Jean:**

What? You mean the fat guy talking to a customer?

什么？你是说那个正在跟顾客聊天的胖子？

**Waiter:**

Exactly.

没错。

**Jean:**

Better not, then.

那还是算了吧。

**Waiter:**

What's up?

怎么了？

**Jean:**

He got me here.

是他把我忽悠到这儿来的。

To find Hong Kong's hottest restaurants, don't bother checking the phone book or going to the city's entertainment districts.

要找到香港最火热的餐厅，别浪费时间查电话簿或前往市内的娱乐区。

These days, the most sought-after tables are hidden away, several floors above ground, in the city's narrow high-rise apartments, which are run by chefs out of their own homes or from rented spaces.

如今，最受追捧的餐位隐藏在高层公寓的几层楼上，这些狭窄的高楼公寓里，不少餐厅由厨师在自家或租来的空间中经营。

With limited seating and irregular working hours, some of these private dining rooms are so popular that they are booked weeks or even months in advance.

由于座位有限且营业时间不规律，这些私人餐厅非常受欢迎，预订通常需要提前数周甚至数月。

And because most are unlicensed and don't advertise, merely requesting a reservation can be as difficult as getting one.

而且，因为大多数餐厅没有营业执照，也不做广告，仅仅是提出预订申请就已经很困难了，更别说成功预订了。

For chefs, the trend is mostly about staying employed.

对于厨师而言，这一趋势主要是为了维持生计。

Many launched their businesses after losing their main sources of incomes.

许多人在失去主要收入来源后开始了这样的经营模式。

Exclusivity is the main attraction for customers in a city that is still obsessed with status, if not showiness.

在一个依然热衷于地位甚至浮华的城市里，这种餐厅的吸引力在于其独特性。

There's the added charm of discovering a hidden treasure that only your inner circle knows about.

而且，发现一个只有你亲密圈子才知道的隐藏宝地，也别有一番魅力。

From the owner's point of view, such tiny restaurants make good business sense.

从餐厅老板的角度来看，这种小型餐厅非常符合商业逻辑。

In the current climate, they can afford to hire well-trained waiters from top hotels and clubs.

在当前的环境下，他们可以负担得起从顶级酒店和俱乐部聘请训练有素的服务员。

The fixed menu also means that chefs buy only what they need for the night.

固定菜单也意味着厨师只需采购当晚所需的食材。

**Joyce:**

Look, Marion, I have some free time this morning. Can I be of any help?

玛丽安，我今天早上有一些空闲时间。我能帮上什么忙吗？

**Marion:**

Oh, thank you, Joyce! You can be a great help.

哦，谢谢你，乔伊斯！你可真是帮了大忙了。

**Joyce:**

Good! What would you like me to do?

太好了！你希望我做些什么呢？

**Marion:**

Well, I can't make up my mind about what to have for dessert.

嗯，我拿不定主意该准备什么甜点。

I made two apple pies last night, but I tasted one of them this morning and it didn't taste good at all.

我昨晚做了两个苹果派，但今天早上尝了一个，味道一点也不好。

**Joyce:**

Let me try it... Ugh! Marion, you forgot to put sugar in the apple filling!

让我尝尝看……呃！玛丽安，你忘了在苹果馅里放糖了！

**Marion:**

Oh no! Will I have to make the pies over again, too?

哦，不！那我是不是还得重新做派啊？

**Joyce:**

You'd better if you don't want Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins making faces over their dessert.

如果你不想看到詹金斯夫妇吃甜点时皱眉头的话，最好还是重做吧。

**Marion:**

Oh, they wouldn't do that. They're too polite.

哦，他们不会那样做的。他们太有礼貌了。

They would just make as if nothing was wrong and then complain to Steve about it later.

他们只会装作没事，然后晚些时候跟史蒂夫抱怨。

**Joyce:**

Look, why don't you just offer some fresh fruit and cheese for dessert?

听着，要不你就直接准备一些新鲜水果和奶酪当甜点吧？

Many people are more aware of proper nutrition nowadays.

现在很多人都更注重健康饮食了。

Steve's parents would probably like a healthy dessert.

史蒂夫的父母可能会喜欢健康的甜点。

**Marion:**

What a good idea! I've got plenty of fruit in my fruit bowl and cheese in the refrigerator.

真是个好主意！我的水果篮里有很多水果，冰箱里也有奶酪。

Thank you so much, Joyce! You see, I was right. You are a great help, indeed!

非常感谢你，乔伊斯！你看，我说得没错，你真是个大帮手！
