# 引语

- 掌握引语的概念

- 作用是转述别人的话

- 直接引语

- 双引号直接原封不动地引用从别人那里听来的话

- He said to me ,"I love you."

- 间接引语

- 站在转达者的立场上，适当改变后传达从别人那里听到的内容

- He told me that he loved me.

- 直接引语变成间接引语的方法

- 陈述句中引语的转换规则

- 去掉逗号和引号，用that代替。that可以省略

- 使用正确的表示转达的动词。（say to->tell,said to -> told等）

- 站在转达者的立场改变直接引语的主语、宾语等。（I->he等)

- 主句谓语的时态

- 现在时

- 不用变，直接用现在时

- 过去时

- 现在变过去

- 过去变过去完成

- 现在完成变过去完成

- 还要站在转达者的立场上改变形容词或副词

- Now->then,this->that,ago->before

- today->that day,next week(year)->the next week(year)

- tomorrow->the next day/the following day

- last night->the night before / the previous night

- 疑问句中引语的转化规则

- 一般疑问句

- 把表示转达的动词say（to）变成ask

- 把要转述的句子的语序变成“if/whether+主语+谓语”
