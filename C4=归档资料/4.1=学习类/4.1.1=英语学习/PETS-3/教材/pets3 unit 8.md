**Karen has just had her house redecorated. Her friend Jenny is visiting her and they are talking about the decoration.**

凯伦刚刚重新装修了她的房子。她的朋友珍妮正在拜访她，两人正在讨论装修的事情。

**Jenny:**

You certainly do have a beautiful home. But how did you two find the time to fix it up so nicely?

你的家真漂亮！但你们俩是怎么找到时间把它弄得这么好的？

**Karen:**

Thanks, but we were lucky enough to have a professional, namely an architect to help us change the structure of the rooms.

谢谢，不过我们很幸运，请了一位专业人士，也就是一位建筑师，来帮我们改造房间的结构。

The architect and Tom put their heads together to discuss what we wanted and what was possible.

建筑师和汤姆一起动脑筋，讨论了我们想要的效果和实际可行的方案。

After a few meetings, they came up with some super ideas that everybody agreed with.

经过几次会议，他们提出了一些非常棒的想法，大家都很满意。

**Jenny:**

But it must’ve been pretty expensive, wasn’t it?

但这应该花了不少钱吧，是不是？

**Karen:**

Architects aren’t very cheap, that’s for sure. But the rest of it was surprisingly inexpensive.

建筑师确实不便宜，这是肯定的。不过剩下的部分出奇地便宜。

Many times, we didn’t even have to buy materials. We were able to make do with the materials we already have.

很多时候，我们甚至不用买材料。我们能够利用现有的材料。

For example, I made up some of the curtains and pillows on the couch from mere sheets.

比如，我用普通的床单做了一些窗帘和沙发上的抱枕。

**Jenny:**

What an interesting idea!

真是个有趣的想法！

**Karen:**

The real problem was the living room. It was really small and not at all special.

真正的问题是客厅。它真的很小，也毫无特色。

The architect suggested adding a fireplace. That makes the room look bigger and gives it more character.

建筑师建议加一个壁炉。这让房间看起来更大，也更有格调。

We were really happy to make that breakthrough.

我们真的很高兴能有这样的突破。

It’s funny how people can find solutions after they kick something around for a while.

真有意思，人们在反复讨论问题后总能找到解决方案。

Talking about it really helps.

聊一聊真的很有帮助。

**Meng Di:**

Come on, Su Ling. Try it. It's fun.

**孟迪：**

**Meng Di:**

Video games now prevail in the world. Millions of people play video games all the time.

**孟迪：**

**Meng Di:**

I have a good collection of video games and I often play them on my home computer.

**孟迪：**

**Su Ling:**

Why don't you play a game or two first, so I can see how to do it.

**苏玲：**

**Meng Di:**

OK. This game is called 

**孟迪：**

**Meng Di:**

This lever in the middle — we call it a joystick — is how you move your gun across the bottom of the screen.

**孟迪：**

**Meng Di: **

The invaders will drop bombs at varying speeds from various places across the screen.

**孟迪：**

**Meng Di:**

Your job is to move your gun underneath them before the bombs hit the ground.

**孟迪：**

**Su Ling:**

Do I shoot them?

**苏玲：**

**Meng Di:**

Yes, by pressing this button over here.

**孟迪：**

**Meng Di:**

If you hold it down, it loads bullets automatically and fires continuously; otherwise, it only fires a burst when you depress it.

**孟迪：**

**Su Ling:**

That's all there is to do it?

**苏玲：**

**Meng Di:**

Well, not exactly.

**孟迪：**

**Meng Di:**

As the game progresses, the invaders come faster and faster and drop more bombs, so you have to move more rapidly and get the guns under them and blast them out of the sky.

**孟迪：**

**Meng Di:**

That's it. Okay, you're on your own.

**孟迪：**

**Su Ling:**

Zap! Pow! Take that, you evil creatures!

**苏玲：**

**Su Ling:**

Oops, that one sneaked past me!

**苏玲：**

**Su Ling:**

Oh, bloody hell! He got me.

**苏玲：**

**Su Ling:**

The little devil was too fast, but I'll get him next time.

**苏玲：**

**Su Ling:**

I'll try again. Oh, this is fun!

**苏玲：**

**Meng Di:**

You're becoming a pro at this game, Su Ling.

**孟迪：**

**Meng Di:**

Your scores are getting higher and higher with this game.

**孟迪：**

**Meng Di:**

Would you like to move on to a more complicated game?

**孟迪：**

**Su Ling:**

Eventually, but for now I'd like to concentrate on getting the best score ever on this game.

**苏玲：**

**Meng Di:**

If you do that, Su Ling, you can enter your initials in the video display to show everyone that you got the highest score.

**孟迪：**

**Su Ling:**

What a good idea!

**苏玲：**

**Su Ling:**

Why don't I come to your house tomorrow again and try my hand on some other games you have on the computer.

**苏玲：**

**Meng Di:**

Su Ling, I think you're hooked.

**孟迪：**

**Making your home safe for young children is a simple but very necessary project for you new parents.**

让家中对幼儿安全是每一位新手父母都必须完成的一项简单但非常重要的任务。

**First, you should locate any materials that could be dangerous or poisonous to children.**

首先，你应该找出家中可能对孩子有危险或有毒的物品。

**These include detergent, ammonia, and medications.**

这些包括清洁剂、氨水和药物。

**We know that even vitamins, when taken by the bottleful, can kill.**

我们知道，即使是维生素，如果整瓶服用，也可能致命。

**Although some of these come with childproof safety caps, many times this is not enough to protect the child.**

尽管有些物品配有防儿童安全盖，但很多时候这并不足以保护孩子。

**The best thing to do with these materials is to put them in a high cabinet in your kitchen or bathroom.**

处理这些物品的最佳方法是将它们放在厨房或浴室的高处柜子里。

**If your cabinets are low enough for a child to reach them, they should be kept locked.**

如果柜子足够低，孩子可以拿到，那么这些柜子应该上锁。

**Next, you should check electrical sockets and wiring.**

接下来，你应该检查电源插座和电线。

**The sockets in your home should be covered with plastic blanks.**

家中的插座应该用塑料插座保护盖盖住。

**These are available at most drug and department stores, and will prevent the child from putting his fingers into the sockets.**

这些保护盖可以在大多数药店和百货商店买到，能够防止孩子将手指插入插座。

**Also, be sure that the wiring for lamps and other appliances don’t become a plaything for your child.**

此外，请确保灯具和其他电器的电线不会成为孩子的玩具。

**The wiring should be placed securely where the child cannot reach it, or it should at least be covered.**

电线应牢固地放置在孩子够不到的地方，或者至少用保护罩盖住。

**This will help prevent electric shock by preventing the child from putting the wire in his mouth.**

这可以通过防止孩子将电线放入口中来有效避免触电事故的发生。

**Finally, don’t be careless.**

最后，不要掉以轻心。

**Don’t leave sharp objects – knives, pins, and so on – lying around.**

不要把尖锐物品——如刀子、大头针等——随意放置。

**And no matter how busy you are, always take time out to check that your child hasn’t gotten hold of something that could hurt him.**

不管你有多忙，都要抽出时间检查，确保孩子没有拿到任何可能伤害他的东西。

I'm a full-time housewife, happy and full-engaged every day.

我是一名全职家庭主妇，幸福且每天都全情投入。

I've been married for 12 years, but quit my job and took up housekeeping the year after my marriage.

我已经结婚12年，在婚后一年辞掉了工作，开始专注于家庭事务。

Daily household chores keep me on my toes; I'm delighted all day long.

每天的家务活让我忙得不可开交，但我乐此不疲。

Humming like a bee around the house, I've never had the feeling of boredom and inanity.

像蜜蜂一样围着家里忙碌，我从未感到无聊或空虚。

Here's my daily routine: first thing in the morning, make coffee for my husband.

以下是我的日常生活：每天早晨第一件事是为我的丈夫煮咖啡。

As he never has breakfast without me, I watch him eat and drink till it's through.

因为他从不在没有我的情况下吃早餐，所以我会看着他吃喝，直到他吃完为止。

Then he puts on the clean clothes I chose for him the night before.

然后，他会穿上我前一天晚上为他挑选好的干净衣服。

While I see my beloved walking out of the house beamingly and briskly out of my sight, my heart blooms with joy and satisfaction.

当我看到我心爱的丈夫面带笑容地走出家门，轻快地离开我的视线时，我的心中充满了喜悦和满足。

Turning round delightedly, I start taking care of my darling kittens, washing and drying them one by one, altogether four.

转过身，我愉快地开始照顾我心爱的猫咪们，把它们一个个洗干净并吹干，总共有四只。

Then I begin cleaning up the house step by step, wiping and polishing every surface and corner, till everywhere, everything in the house looks bright and clean.

接着，我开始一步步地打扫房子，擦拭并抛光每个角落和表面，直到整个家都变得明亮整洁。

How I love hearing my husband say, "What a nice and comfortable home I have!" when he gets home!

我最喜欢听到丈夫回家时说：“我有一个多么舒适的家啊！”

In a moment, it's noontime.

很快就到了中午。

After a simple lunch for myself, I switch on the computer, work on my own website and browse among others ...

我简单地吃了点午饭，然后开始在电脑上工作，更新自己的网站并浏览其他网站……

By 6:00 p.m. or so, it's time for me to get dinner ready.

到了下午6点左右，就该准备晚餐了。

That's the "tremendous business" for me out of the three meals a day, for, except for the weekends, my husband and I have only this meal together.

一天三餐中，晚餐对我来说算是“重头戏”，因为除了周末以外，我和丈夫只有这一顿饭是一起吃的。

Besides, he always has his lunch in a neglected way at his workplace.

另外，他在工作时总是随便对付午餐。

He needs nutrition from the dinner I prepared for him most of all.

而我为他准备的晚餐是他最需要的营养来源。
