**什么是分词？**

动词的形态发生变化起形容词作用修饰名词时，就叫做分词

# 分词的种类

- 错误的，sleep是动词，不能修饰名词baby.

- 现在分词不代表现在时态，也可以用于过去时和将来时，而是含有**主动、进行意思**的形容词

# 现在分词和动名词

- 如何区别，两个都是加-ing

- waithing people,waiting room

- waithing people，是形容词，等待的人们

- room是房间，不能翻译为等待的房间，所以是动词，等候室

- 动名词是作主宾补，而现在分词是作形容词

# 分词的作用

- 修饰名词

- 现在分词

- Look at the sleeping baby.

- 只有一个单词，所以位于名词前

- I read an interesting book.

- Look at the girl playing the piano.

- 两个及以上单词构成的短语，所以放在名词后，修饰the girl

- 过去分词

- Look at the broken window.

- I bought a used car.

- I have a phone made in China.

- 作表语

- 现在分词

- The baby is crying.

- This book is boring.

- 过去分词

- She was surrounded by kids.

- He is bored.

- 作宾语补足语

- 现在分词

- I saw her running.

- I heard him singing.

- I watched a boy crying.

- 过去分词

- I saw the door painted.

- I heard my name called.

- I watched the bike repaired.

- 叙述性

- I found the book interesting.

- 我找到了有趣的书。

- 这样翻译是错误的，因为转化为现在分词后就被限定了，不能翻译为......的

- 我发现那本书很有趣。

# 动词的三种变形

英语中的动词原本只是作谓语，但是可以通过改变动词的形态，让他起名词、形容词、分词的作用。

| 动词不定式 | 动名词 | 分词 | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 作用 | 名词、形容词、副词 | 名词 | 形容词 | 
| 公式 | to+v | V-ing | V-ing/V-ed | 
| 范例 | to drink | drinking | drinking/drunk | 


**英语中掌握了名词、动词、形容词、副词的作用与动词的变形，几乎就掌握了基础的英语语法。**
