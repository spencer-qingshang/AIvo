不久，孩子们就离开了镇子，来到了大道上。天上又大又圆的黄色月亮给他们照明了道路。

Soon the Children left the twon and came to a road. The big yellow moon was out, and they could see the road very well.

“我们得快点走。​”亨利说，​“希望面包店老板和他的妻子还没醒，不知道我们已经走了。​

"We must walk fast." said Henry. "I hope the baker and his wife don't wake up and find us gone."

他们用最快的速度沿着大道快步行进。

They walk down the road as fast as they could.

维奥莱特问道：​“你还能抱着本尼走多远？​”

"How far you carry Benny?" asked Violet.

亨利回答：​“我可以抱着他走很远。​”

"Oh, I can carry him a long time." replied Henry.

但是杰西说：​“我觉得如果叫醒本尼，我们会走得更快一点。我们可以拉着他的手，带着他一起走。​”

But Jeesie said, "I think we could go faster if we woke him up now. We can take his hands and help him along."

亨利停下了脚步，把本尼放了下来。

Henry stopped and put Benny down.

他说：​“本尼，醒醒，现在你必须下来自己走路。​”

“Come, Benry.”he said. "You must wake up and walk now."

“走开！”本尼说。

"Go away." said Benry.

维奥莱特说：​“让我试试。本尼，现在我们玩个游戏。假如你是一只小棕熊，正在寻找一张温暖舒适的床。亨利和杰西会帮助你，我们一起来找床。​”

"Let me try" said Violet. "Now, Benny, you can play that you are a little brown bear and are running away to find a worm bed. Henny and Jeeise will help you, and we'II find a bed."

本尼本来就喜欢做一只小棕熊，所以他睁开了眼睛。亨利和杰西拉着他的手，他们又继续赶路。

Benny liked being a little brown bear, and so he woke up and opened his eyes. Henry and Jeesie are took his hands, and they all went on again.

他们经过一些农舍，但里面都是黑漆漆、静悄悄的，一个人都没有。他们走了很久，太阳才渐渐升起。

They passed some farmhouses, and the house were dark and quiet. They did not see anyone. They walked and walked for a long time. Then the red sun began to come up.

“我们得找个地方睡觉。​”杰西说，​“我太累了。​”

"We must find a place to sleep." said Jeesie. "I am so tried."

小本尼睡着了，亨利继续抱着他赶路，其他几个孩子则开始寻找落脚的地方。

Little Benny was asleep, and Henry was carrying him again. The other children began to look for a place.

终于，维奥莱特指着一间农舍旁边的大干草堆说：​“看那里！”

At last Violet said, "Look over there." She was pointing at a big haystack in a field near a farmhouse.

“这个地方不错，维奥莱特。​”亨利说，​“好大的一个草堆！”

"A fine place, Violet!" said Henry! "What a big haystack it is!"

孩子们穿过田地，向农舍跑去。他们跨过一条小溪，来到了干草堆。亨利的怀里还抱着本尼。

杰西在草堆里给本尼做了一个小窝，当把本尼放进去的时候，他立刻又进入了梦乡。其他的孩子也各自做了小窝。

亨利笑着说：​“晚安！”

杰西答道：​“我觉得应该是‘早安’。我们白天睡觉，晚上赶路。等到了晚上，我们再起来，走远一些。​”
