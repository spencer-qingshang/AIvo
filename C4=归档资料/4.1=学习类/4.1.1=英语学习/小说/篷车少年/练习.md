一个温暖的夜晚，四个孩子站在一家面包店的门前。没有人认识他们，也没有人知道他们从哪儿来。

One warm night four children stood in front bakery. No one knew them. No one knew where they had come from.

面包店老板的妻子最先发现了这四个孩子，他们正从面包店的窗户向里面张望。

The baker's wife saw them first, as they stood looking in at the windows of her store.

那个小一点的男孩正盯着蛋糕，大一些的男孩打量着一个个面包，而两个女孩则看着饼干。

The little boy was looking at the cakes, the big boy was looking at the loaves of bread, and the two girls were looking at the cookies.

面包店的老板娘可不喜欢孩子，尤其不喜欢男孩子。于是，她走到面包店门前，侧耳倾听，看起来非常生气。

Now the bakery's wife didn't like children. She didn't like boys at all. So she came to the front of the bakery and listened, looking very cross.

小男孩说：​“杰西，这块蛋糕看上去不错。​”他大概五岁。

"The cake is good, Jeeise." the little boy said. He was about five years old.

“是的，本尼。​”大一些的女孩说道，​“但是面包更适合你，是吧，亨利？​”

"Yes, Benry." said the big girl, "But bread is better for you, Itsn't it? Henry?"

“是的。​”亨利答道，​“我们得吃些面包，蛋糕对本尼和维奥莱特来说可不怎么好。

"Oh,yes." said Henry. "We must have some bread, and cake isn't good for Benry and Violet."

​”维奥莱特说道：​“不管怎么说，我最喜欢面包啦！”维奥莱特大约十岁，她有着漂亮的棕色头发和眼睛。

"I like bread best, anyway." said Violet. she was about ten years old, and she has pretty brown hair and brown eyes.

亨利笑着对她说：​“这才对嘛。维奥莱特，我们进去吧。兴许他们能让我们在这儿过夜。​”

"That is just like you. Violet"" said Henry, smilling at her. Let's go into the bakery. Maybe they will let us stay here for the night."

当孩子们走进面包店的时候，面包店的老板娘一直盯着他们。

The bakery's wife looked at them, as they came in.

“我想要三个面包，谢谢。​”杰西说。

"I want three loaves of bread, please." said Jessie.

她冲着老板娘礼貌地微笑，但老板娘却板着脸，没有笑。她看着亨利从口袋里掏出钱，虽然十分生气，但她还是把面包卖给了亨利。

She smailed politely at the woman, but the woman didn't smile. She looked at Henry as he put his hand in his potcted. She looked cross, but she sold him the bread.

杰西也在四处打量，她看到每扇窗户下面都有一个红色的长椅，上面还放着扁平的红色枕头。

Jeeise was looking around, too, and she saw a long red bench under each windows of the bakery. The benches had flat red pillow on them.

“你能让我们在这里住一晚吗？​”杰西问道，​“我们可以睡在那些长椅上，明天我们还能帮你洗盘子，打打杂。​”

"Will you let us stay here for the night?" Jeeise asked. "We could sleep on those benches, and tomorrow we would help you wash the dishes and do things for you."

这下子老板娘高兴了。她非常讨厌洗盘子，要是有个大男孩能帮她洗盘子可真不错。

Now the woman liked this. She didn't like to wash dishes very well. she would like to have a big boy to help her with her work.

“你们的爸爸妈妈呢？​”老板娘问。

"Where are you father and mother?" she asked.

亨利说：​“他们都去世了。​”

"They are dead." said Henry.

本尼接着说：​“我们在格林菲尔德有一个爷爷，但我们不喜欢他。​”

"We have a grandfather in Greenfield, but we didn't like him." said Benry.

杰西连忙用手捂住本尼的嘴，不让他再多说话。

Jessis put her hand over the little boy's mouth before he say more.

“本尼，别说了！”她说道。

"Oh, Benry, keep still!" she said.

“为什么你们不喜欢你们的爷爷呢？​”老板娘问。

"Why don't you like your father?" asked the woman.

“他是我们父亲的父亲，他不喜欢我们的妈妈。​”亨利答道，​“所以我们觉得他也不会喜欢我们。我们害怕他会对我们很刻薄。​”

"He is our father's father, and he didn't like our mother." Henry said. “So we don't think he would like us. We are afriad he would be mean to us.”

“那你们见过他吗？​”老板娘接着问道。

"Did you ever see him?" the woman asked.

“没有。​”亨利答道。

"No." answered Henry.

“那你们怎么觉得他会对你们刻薄呢？​”老板娘问。

"Then why do you think he would be mean to you?" the woman asked.

“因为他从来没来看过我们。​”亨利说，​“他根本不喜欢我们。​”

"Well, he never came to see us." Henry said. "He does't like us at all."

“来这儿之前你们住在哪儿？​”老板娘问。

"Where did you live before you came here?" asked the woman.

四个孩子谁都没有回答她。

But not one of the four children would tell her.

杰西说：​“我们不会吵到你的，我们就在这儿待一晚。​”

"We'II get along all right." Jeesie said. "We want to stay here for only one night."

老板娘最后说：​“今晚你们可以在这儿住下，明天我看看你们能干些什么。​”

"You may stay here tonight." said the woman at last. "And tomorrow we'II see you what we can do."

亨利礼貌地对老板娘表示感谢，他说道：​“我们都累了，肚子也饿了。​”

Henry thanked her politely. he said. "We are petty tired and hugrry."

孩子们坐在地上，亨利把其中一个面包用刀切成了四份，然后孩子们就开始吃上了。

The children sat down on floor. Henry cut one of the loaves of bread into four pieces with his knife, and the children began to eat.

“好吃！”亨利说道。

"Delicious!" said Henry.

“真没见过世面！”老板娘说。

"Well, I never!" said the woman.

她走进了旁边的房间，关上了门。

She went into the next  room and shut the door.

本尼边吃边说：​“她走了真是太好了，她不喜欢我们。​”

"I'm glad she is gone," remarked Benny, eating. "She does't like us."

“嘘，本尼！”杰西说，​“她能让我们睡在这里已经很好了。​”

"Sh, Benny." said Jeeise. "she is good to let us sleep here."

晚饭过后，孩子们躺在了红色长椅上，维奥莱特和本尼不一会儿就睡着了。

After supper the children lay down on red long benches, and Violet and Benny soon went to sleep.

但杰西和亨利还能听见老板娘说话的声音，她正和面包店老板聊天。

But Jeeise and Henry could hear the woman talking to the baker.

她说：​“我要把三个大一点的孩子留下来，他们能帮上忙。但是那个小不点必须去儿童之家。他太小了，我可照顾不了他。​”

She said, "I'II keep the three older children. They can help me. But the little boy must go to the Children's Home. I can not take of him."

面包店老板答道：​“好主意。明天我就把那个小男孩带去儿童之家。我们可以让剩下的三个孩子在这儿待上一阵子，但我们必须得让他们说出他们的爷爷是谁。​”

The baker answered, "Very well. Tomorrow I'II take the little boy to the Children's Home. We'II keep"

杰西和亨利一直等到面包店夫妇入睡。然后，他们在黑暗中坐了起来。

Jeesie and Henry waited until the baker and his wife. Then they sat up in the dark.

杰西小声说：​“亨利，我们得从这儿逃出去！”

"Sh, Henry." whispered Jeesie. "Let's run away from here."

亨利说：​“没错！我们绝对不能让本尼去儿童之家！绝对不能！绝对不能！天亮之前，我们得离这儿远远的，否则他们会找到我们的。还有，我们绝对不能在这里落下任何东西。​”

“Yes, indeed!” said Henry. We never let Benny go to a Children's Home. Never, never. We must be far from here by morning, or they will find us. But we must not leave any of our things hre."

杰西静静地坐着，认真地思考着。

Jeesie sat still, thinking.

她说：​“我们的衣服、一块香皂和毛巾在那个大洗衣袋里，维奥莱特有她自己的小工具包。我们还剩两个面包。你还带着你的刀和钱吧？​”

"Our cloths and a cake of soap and towel are in the big laundry." she said. "Violet has her little workbag. And we have two loaves of bread. Have you your knife and money?"

“带着呢。​”亨利说，​“我差不多还有四美元。​”

"Yes," said Henry. "I have almost four dollars."

“你得抱着本尼。​”杰西说，​“我们要是叫醒他，他肯定会哭。我去叫醒维奥莱特。​”

“You must carry Benny.” said Jeesie. "He will cry if we woke him up. But I'II wake Violet."

“嘘，维奥莱特！来！我们又得逃跑了。我们要是不跑，面包店老板明天早上就要把本尼送去儿童之家！”

"Sh, Violet! Come! We are going to run away again. If we don't run away, the baker will take Benny to a Children's Home."

小女孩一下子就清醒了。她坐了起来，然后滚下了长椅，但她没发出任何声音。

The little girl woke up at once. She sat up and rolled off the bench, but she didn't make any nosie.

维奥莱特轻声问：​“我应该做什么？​”

"What shall I do?" she whishpred solity.

“拿着这个。​”杰西说。她把工具包递给维奥莱特。

"Carry this." said Jeeise. She gave her the workbag.

杰西把两个面包放进洗衣袋，然后她打量了一下房间。

Jeesie put two loaves of bread into the laundry, and then she looked around the room.

“没有东西落下了。​”她对亨利说，​“抱着本尼。​”

"All right," she said to Henry. "Take Benny now."

亨利抱起本尼，走到了面包店门口。杰西拿着洗衣袋，轻轻打开了店门。四个孩子一句话都没有说，悄悄地出了门。杰西关上门，然后他们仔细地听着，周围一片安静。于是，这四个孩子沿着街道出发了。

Henry carry Benny in his arms and came to in the door of the bakery. Jeesic took the big laundry and opened the door very soflt. They didn't say a word. Jeesie shut the door, and then they all listened. Anything was very quiet. So the four children went down the street.
