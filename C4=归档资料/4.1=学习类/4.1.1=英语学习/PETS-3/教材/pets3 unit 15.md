People in the travel industry as well as passengers say the sobering effects from 9/11 are having a big impact on all of that. 

航空业从业人员和乘客都表示，9·11事件带来的警醒效应正对此产生重大影响。

But if there is a hint of good news, people seem to be regaining their confidence in the airline industry. 

但如果有一丝好消息的话，那就是人们似乎正在恢复对航空业的信心。

More Americans are going to be flying this weekend than at any other time since September 11. 

本周末乘坐飞机出行的美国人数量将创下自9·11事件以来的新高。

Now, we are at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport this morning with a look at the start of a very busy weekend air travel schedule. 

今晨我们在亚特兰大哈茨菲尔德国际机场，带您直击繁忙的周末航空出行季开端。

We are seeing pretty healthy lines for this time of the morning, both at check-in outside and at the ticketing counters inside as well. 

无论是航站楼外的值机区域还是内部售票柜台，清晨时分的排队人流已经相当可观。

It is a far different world today than it was last Memorial Day, and what a year ago would have been perceived perhaps as an inconvenience is now being embraced as extra security checks. 

与去年阵亡将士纪念日相比，如今已是全然不同的世界——那些一年前可能被视为麻烦的额外安检措施，现在已被公众坦然接受。

Even if there is any irritation from the long lines or extra security checks, the passengers that we talked to so far aren't showing it. 

尽管长队和额外安检可能引发不快，但我们采访的乘客都表现得十分克制。

Patience is going to be the key word. 

耐心将是这个假日的关键词。

As estimated, a quarter of a million people are going to be flying out of Hartsfield Airport today. 

据估算，今日将有25万人次从哈茨菲尔德机场启程。

That's only up slightly from a Friday average, but across the country, 4.1 million people are going to be flying today. 

较普通周五客流量仅有小幅上升，但就全美范围而言，今日航空旅客量将达到410万人次。

That is actually down 7 percent from last year. 

较去年同期实际下降7%。
