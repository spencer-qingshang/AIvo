I've got some bad news.

I can't make it.

You would make it.

What's up?

The thing is, the timing is awful.

You see, it's my wife's birthday today.

It's kind of complicated.

It's a long story.

It's difficult to explain.

我有一个坏消息。

我去不了。/ 我办不到。

你会成功的。/ 你（原本）能做到的。

怎么了？/ 嘿，你好吗？

问题是，时间点太不凑巧了。

你看（你也知道），今天是我妻子的生日。

这事儿有点复杂。

说来话长。

这很难解释。
