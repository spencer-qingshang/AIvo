**Harry**

I've taken over as chief consultant for all of our East Coast offices, you know. I took on so much work that I hardly have time for my own family.

**哈里**

我现在成了我们东海岸所有办事处的首席顾问，你知道的。我接了太多的工作，几乎没有时间陪自己的家人了。

**Clyde**

That's a big job! Is Betty happy about that?

**克莱德**

那可是个大职位！贝蒂对此满意吗？

**Harry**

To be honest with you, Clyde, she isn’t pleased at all. Because she’s a working mother, she thinks I ought to help her take care of the kids and the housework.

**哈里**

跟你说实话，克莱德，她一点也不高兴。因为她是个职业母亲，她觉得我应该帮她一起照顾孩子和做家务。

**Clyde**

You’re in the same spot I was in when Patricia went back to work after the baby was born. She soon called my attention to the fact that she couldn’t work full time and keep house, too. I decided a change of plans was called for, and I began coming straight home from work to help her out. Now while she feeds the baby, I wash the dishes or even cook the meal. I don’t think we men spend enough time with our kids.

**克莱德**

你现在的处境跟我当时很像。帕特里夏生完孩子后重新回去工作，很快就跟我说，她没办法全职工作还同时打理家务。我觉得必须要做出改变了，于是开始下班后直接回家帮忙。现在，她喂宝宝的时候，我会洗碗甚至做饭。我觉得我们男人花在孩子身上的时间太少了。

**Harry**

Never thought much about stuff like that. I guess I just took it for granted that a wife was supposed to take care of her kids and husband. I didn’t think about them needing me — except to bring home the paycheck.

**哈里**

我以前从没想过这些事。我想当然地认为，妻子就应该照顾孩子和丈夫。我从没想过他们也需要我——除了我赚工资养家之外。

**Clyde**

They do need you, Harry, especially the kids. You can’t just take it for granted that they know you love them. You’ve got to get to know them.

**克莱德**

他们确实需要你，哈里，尤其是孩子们。你不能想当然地认为他们知道你爱他们。你得去真正了解他们。

**Harry**

Well, I told Betty that it was her job to rear the kids, but maybe I’d better take that back and give her a hand.

**哈里**

嗯，我跟贝蒂说过，带孩子是她的工作，但或许我该收回这话，帮她一把。

**Clyde**

You can’t change everything all at once, though. Take your time. Adjust your schedule so you can be at home more. Get Betty to take off on some trips with you. I’ll bet her mom would take over the house for her.

**克莱德**

不过，你也不能一下子改变所有事情。慢慢来吧。调整一下你的日程，多待在家里。带着贝蒂一起出去旅行。我敢说她妈妈一定愿意帮忙照料家里的事。

**Harry**

Maybe you’re right.

**哈里**

也许你说得对。

**Clyde**

Believe me, you won’t regret it. It’s a real challenge to take on, Harry, but the kids won’t wait. They’ll be grown and gone before you know it.

**克莱德**

相信我，你不会后悔的。哈里，这确实是个挑战，但孩子不会等你。他们很快就会长大，离开你了。

**Harry**

Thanks for the advice, good buddy.

**哈里**

谢谢你的建议，好兄弟。

**Eileen:**

Please put your cigarette out. The smoke gives me a headache.

请把烟掐了，烟味让我头疼。

**Frank:**

OK! OK! You know, I hate to see women sitting down all day with their heads buried in their hands.

好吧，好吧！我真不喜欢看到女人整天坐着，低头忙活着什么东西。

**Eileen:**

Do you want me to put my needlework away?

你是想让我把刺绣收起来吗？

**Frank:**

You bet!

没错！

**Eileen:**

I am putting forth a lot of effort to make this tablecloth. You always complain about whatever you see me doing. I can't put up with your constant criticism anymore.

我可是花了不少心思在做这块桌布。你总是对我做的事情指指点点。我再也受不了你不停的挑剔了。

**Frank:**

I'm sorry, sweetie. Please forgive my bad temper. I was putting a machine together today, and I had problems with it. I'm tired. Will you please forgive me?

对不起，亲爱的。原谅我脾气不好吧。我今天在组装一台机器，遇到了一些问题，弄得我很累。你能原谅我吗？

**Eileen:**

This time I will, but please don't put me down anymore.

这次我原谅你，但以后别再贬低我了。

**Frank:**

Honey, I've put aside some money that I earned by doing some extra mechanical work. Would you like to go out to dinner tonight, just the two of us?

亲爱的，我攒了一些做额外机械活儿赚的钱。今晚我们俩一起出去吃顿饭怎么样？

**Eileen:**

How exciting! I'll take a shower and put on my best dress. Oh, here's an advertisement for that new Italian restaurant in the shopping mall.

太棒了！我去洗个澡，然后穿上我最漂亮的裙子。哦，这里有一张商场里那家新开的意大利餐厅的广告。

**Frank:**

Mmm! Look at these photographs. They put me in the mood for Italian food. Would you like to try this new place?

嗯！看看这些照片，真让我想吃意大利菜。你想去试试这家新餐厅吗？

**Eileen:**

Can we afford it?

我们负担得起吗？

**Frank:**

Don't worry! We can manage. Payday is tomorrow!

别担心！我们能应付得了，明天就发工资了！

Let's see... Maybe the white dress you wore for New Year's.

让我想想……也许你可以穿那条新年时穿的白色连衣裙。

**Tami:**

**塔米：**

I really am lucky to have David. He's so thoughtful!

我真的很幸运能有大卫。他太贴心了！

He always goes beyond my expectations.

他总是超出我的期待。

**Jennifer:**

**詹妮弗：**

Would you like me to babysit for you?

要不要我帮你照看孩子？

**Tami:**

Everything I say goes in one ear and out the other.

Larry: All right. Listen; give me a break, huh?

拉里:好吧,听我说,给我个机会行不?

I've been trying to cut down on our expenses lately.

I've been shutting off the lights when I leave the room;

关灯走人、

I've been keeping track of all of our phone bills...

认真记录电话费账单...

Deb: Well, maybe, but you've been turning up the heat to 70°F every day and that's been costing us an additional $70 to $80 a month.

黛布:也是,但你一直把温度调到华氏70度,这导致我们每月多花70到80美元。

Larry: Now wait. Now wait. I've had to do that.

拉里:等等,等等。我必须这么做,

You know I get sick every single time the temperature goes below 68°F. Deb, you know that.

你知道每次华氏低于68度,我就会生病的。黛布,你清楚的。

Deb: Oh, oh. Look at this telephone bill!

It's for $98! That's impossible! 

98美元!这也太离谱了!

I know we've been making some long distance calls lately, but this is ridiculous! 

我知道我们最近打了不少长途电话,但这也太过分了吧!
