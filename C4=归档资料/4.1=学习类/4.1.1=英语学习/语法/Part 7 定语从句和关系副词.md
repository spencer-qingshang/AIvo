# 关系副词的概念

- This is the place.I was born in the place.

- This is the place and I was born in the place.

- 不够简炼

- This is the place I was born in which.

- which不能放在后面

- This is the place which I was born in.

- 可以把介词放在关系代词前

- This is the place in which I was born.

- 将in which换成where，所以介词+关系代词可以用关系副词代替

- This is the place where I was born.

- This is the place and I was born there.

- This is the place where I was born.

- 代替and there为where起副词作用所以叫关系副词

- that代替关系副词

- This is the place where I was born.
