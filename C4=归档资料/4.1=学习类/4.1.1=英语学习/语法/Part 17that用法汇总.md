# 引导名词性从句的that

- 主语

- That she is a teacher is true.

- It is true that Shrek married Princess Fiona.

- 不能省略that，用了形式主语可以省略that

- 宾语

- I know that she is a teacher.

- 表语

- The problem is that she is a teacher.

# 引导定语从句的that

that关系代词可用于指代人、事物、动物，但是不能用于所有格。

如何区分that引导的是名词性从句还是定语动词

定语从句前面要有先行词

that引导的是完成的句子则是名词性从句，句子不完整则是定语从句

# 引导状语从句的that

- 表示原因

- If I go looking there,it is that she wants it.

- 表示目的

- I am looking for a job so that I can help him.

- 表示情感

- I am sorry that you feel that way.

- 表示判断

- He must be mad that he should do such a thing.

- 表示结果

- 不能单独使用，要结合so或such

- He saved money little by little,so taht he could build a new house.

- 也可以分开so和that，表示结果

- The problem was so difficult that I could not solve it.

- so...that...后有can't,就表示“太......而不能......”的意思。可易用动词不定式的副词性用法，换成 too..to...的形式

- This book is so difficult that I can't read it.

- This book is too difficult for me to read.

- it可以省略，因为和this book重复了。

- This box is so heavy that I can't lift it.

- This box is too heavy for me to lift.

- The shoes are so expensive that I can't buy them.

- The shoes are too expensive for me to buy.

- such...that...和so...that...的用法区别？

- 想强调形容词或副词

- so beautiful

- so quietly

- 想强调名词时

- such a kind boy

- such a huge success

# 表示强调的that

- 强调某个事情或人，用It be...that,把要强调的内容放在It be和that之间

- It was Nancy that I met in the park yesterday.

- It was in the park that I met Nancy yesterday.

- It was yesterday that I met Nancy in the park.

- It was I that met Nancy in the park yesterday.

- 当翻译成名词性从句或定语从句不顺时，要想到这是强调用法，所以去掉It be ...that...依然是完整的句子

- I bought the book

- It was on Monday that I bought the book.

- 如何区分形式主语it开头和强调的it

- 看看去掉it be...that...后的句子成不成立

- It is true that we were a little late

- True we were a little late.

- It is you that are to blame.

- You are to blame.

# 表示同位语的that

- He doesn't know the fact that I'm a doctor.

- 有先行词，去掉that引导的从句也完整，不知道是定语从句还是名词性从句

- 先行词和that后表示的内容相同时，则是同位语

- the fact that...

- You should admit the fact that she is only a five year old girl.
