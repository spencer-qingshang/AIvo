You're driving me crazy.

This computer is annoying me.

I'm fed up with the music.

What's wrong?

What's the matter?

What's up?

I'd had enough.

I can't take this anymore.

I can't stand it anymore.

Don't take it out on me.

你快让我疯了。/ 你烦死我了。

这台电脑真让我心烦。

我受够这音乐了。

怎么了？/ 出了什么事？

我（那时候）已经受够了。

我再也受不了这个了。/ 我再也忍不下了。

别拿我撒气。
