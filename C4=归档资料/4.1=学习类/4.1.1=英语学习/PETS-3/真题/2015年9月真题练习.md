### Part A
**Directions:** Read the following two texts. Answer the questions on each text by choosing A, B, C or D.

**Text 1**

Elizabeth Freeman was born about 1742 to African American parents who were slaves. At the age of six months she was acquired, along with her sister, by John Ashley, a wealthy Massachusetts slaveholders. She became known as "Mumbet" or "Mum Bett".

For nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family. One day, Ashley's wife tried to strike Mumbet's sister with a spade. Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer. Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued for her freedom.

While serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution.

Strangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Sedgewick. Mumbet died in 1829, but her legacy lived on in her many descendants. One of her great-grandchildren was W. E. B. Du Bois, one of the founders of the NAACP, and an important writer and spokesperson for African American civil rights.

Mumbet's tombstone still stands in the Massachusetts cemetery where she was buried. It reads, in part: "She was born a slave and remained a slave for nearly thirty years. She could neither read nor write, yet in her own sphere she had no superior or equal."

26. **What do we know about Mumbet according to Paragraph 1?**
    [A] She was born a slave.
    [B] She was a slaveholder.
    [C] She had a famous sister.
    [D] She was born in a rich family.

27. **Why did Mumbet run away from the Ashleys?**
    [A] She found an employer.
    [B] She was hit and got angry.
    [C] She wanted to be a lawyer.
    [D] She had to take care of her sister.

28. **What did Mumbet learn from discussions about the new constitution?**
    [A] How to apply for a job.
    [B] How to be a good servant.
    [C] She should always obey her owners' orders.
    [D] She should be as free and equal as whites.

29. **What did Mumbet do after the trial?**
    [A] She founded the NAACP.
    [B] She chose to work for a lawyer.
    [C] She continued to serve the Ashleys.
    [D] She went to live with her grandchildren.

30. **What is the text mainly about?**
    [A] A story of a famous writer and spokesperson.
    [B] The friendship between a lawyer and a slave.
    [C] The life of a brave African American woman.
    [D] A trial that shocked the whole world.

**Text 2**

"We are not about to enter the Information Age, but instead are rather well into it." Present predictions are that by 1990, about thirty million jobs in the United States, or about thirty percent of the job market, will be computer-related. In 1980, only twenty-one percent of all American high schools owned one or two computers for student use. In the fall of 1985, a new study showed that half of United States secondary schools have fifteen or more computers for student use. And now educational experts, administrators, and even the general public are demanding that all students become "computer-literate". By the year 2000 knowledge of computers will be necessary in over eighty percent of all occupations. Soon those people not educated in computer use will be compared to those who are "print-illiterate" today.

What is "computer literacy"? The term itself seems to imply some degree of "knowing" about computers, but knowing what? The present opinion seems to be that this should include a general knowledge, of what computers are, plus a little of their history and something of how they operate.

Therefore, it is important that educators everywhere take a careful look not only at what is being done, but also at what should be done in the field of computer education. Today most adults are able to use a motor car without the slightest knowledge of how the internal combustion engine works. We effectively use all types of electrical equipment without being able to tell their histories or to explain how they work.

Business people for years have made good use of typewriters and adding machines, yet few have ever known how to repair them. Why, then, attempt to teach computers by teaching how or why they work?

Rather, we first must fix our mind on teaching the effective use of the computer as the tool is.

"Knowing how to use a computer is what's going to be important. We don't talk about 'automobile literacy'. We just get in our cars and drive them."

31. **In 1990, the number of jobs having nothing to do with computers in the United States will be reduced to?**
    [A] 30 million.
    [B] 70 million.
    [C] 79 million.
    [D] 100 million.

32. **The underlined part "print-illiterate" in the text refers to _______.**
    [A] one who has never learnt to read
    [B] one who has never learnt to read
    [C] one who is not a computer literate
    [D] one who is not able to use a typewriter

33. **What is the first paragraph mainly about?**
    [A] The wide of computers in schools.
    [B] Public interest in computers.
    [C] The urgency of computers education.
    [D] Recent predictions of computer-related jobs.

34. **According to the author, the effective way to spread the use of computers is to teach _______.**
    [A] what computers use
    [B] how computers work
    [C] how to use computers
    [D] where computers can be used

35. **From the text, we can infer that _______.**
    [A] illiteracy rate will be down.
    [B] computers will be easy to operate
    [C] computers will he set in automobiles
    [D] automobile will be move comfortable

### Part B
**Directions:** Read the texts from a magazine article in which five people wrote about their ideas towards workaholism. For questions 36-40, match the name of each person to one of the statements (A-G) given below. Mark your answers on your ANSWER SHEET.

**Martin:**
I work not because I like it but that I have to, so I often count the minutes until slopping work or holidays. However, my sister is totally different. She enjoys her work so much that she often spends extra time on her job even takes work home with her. I think she is so crazy about work just as some people are about drugs or alcohol. I could hardly understand it.

**Joseph:**
Work is a core element of our lives. It gives us a sense of identity in the larger world outside the personal circle of family and friends. However, there are some people for whom work occupies an even more central place in their lives. Workaholics are a stereotype of modern life, and they are both praised and criticized. On the one hand, it may be the accepted way of earning promotion. On the other hand, workaholics are often viewed as neglecting aspects of life such as family and leisure that are important for maintaining a healthy equilibrium.

**Malcolm:**
In cities, workaholism is so common that people do not regard it as unusual. I think workaholics prefer to work rather than do anything else because they don't know how to kill time if they don't work. They can only get pleasure from work. Work is everything for them.

**Emily:**
Workaholism is dangerous in a sense because it can cause some problems. First of all, workaholics often have health problems because they don't have time to relax and keep themselves occupied all the time. Secondly, their family life is not happy since they spend little time with their family. Their marriage may even end in divorce.

**Linda:**
Being a workaholic can mean you achieve great things, but more people achieve great things without being addicted to work. Workaholics need time away from work and when I say "away from" I mean psychologically distanced from it as well as physically. If you are still obsessing about work when you should be focused on your loved ones or an outside of work activity then you are still basically working.

**Statements**

[A] If you don't get rid of workaholism, you may get ill.
[B] To get promotion, you need to be a workaholic.
[C] Workaholics' behaviors are hard to understand.
[D] Workaholics had better have some time with no work.
[E] Workaholics don't know how to enjoy themselves except working.
[F] It's hard for workaholics to be away from work psychologically.
[G] Some people appreciate those who pay almost all their attention on work.

36. Martin: [ ]
37. Joseph: [ ]
38. Malcolm: [ ]
39. Emily: [ ]
40. Linda: [ ]

## SECTION III Writing (45 minutes)

### Part A
56. Suppose you are a major in Art of Central Academy of Fine Arts. After graduation you decide to pursue your study in the graduate school in Yale University. Write a letter of application for admission, which should include the following points:
1) make an application;
2) provide your personal information and academic documents;
3) express your hope for a reply.
You should write about 100 words. Do not sign your own name at the end of your letter. Use "Wang Lin" instead.

### Part B
57. **Directions:**
Read the text below. Write an essay in about 120 words, in which you should summarize the key points of the text and make comments on them. Try to use your own words.

In the 1960s, medical researchers Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe developed a checklist of stressful events. They appreciated the tricky point that any major change can be stressful. Negative events like "serious illness of a family member" were high on the list, but so were some positive life-changing events, like marriage. When you take the Holmes-Rahe test you must remember that the score does not reflect how you deal with stress---it only shows how much you have to deal with. And we now know that the way you handle these events dramatically affects your chances of staying healthy.

By the early 1970s, hundreds of similar studies had followed Holmes and Rahe. And millions of Americans who work and live under stress worried over the reports. Somehow, the research got boiled down to a memorable message. Women's magazines ran headlines like "Stress causes illness!" If you want to stay physically and mentally healthy, the articles said, avoid stressful events.

But such simplistic advice is impossible to follow. Even if stressful events are dangerous, many---like the death of a loved one---are impossible to avoid. Moreover, any warning to avoid all stressful events is a prescription for staying away from opportunities as well as trouble. Since any change can be stressful, a person who wanted to be completely free of stress would never marry, have a child, take a new job or move.

The notion that all stress makes you sick also ignores a lot of what we know about people. It assumes we're all vulnerable and passive in the face of adversity. But what about human initiative and creativity? Many come through periods of stress with more physical and mental vigor than they had before. We also know that a long time without change or challenge can lead to boredom, and physical and mental strain.
