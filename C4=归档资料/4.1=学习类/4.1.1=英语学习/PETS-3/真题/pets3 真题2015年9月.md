Five-year-old Elia arrived at school with a big box of colored pencils.

五岁的艾莉亚带着一大盒彩色铅笔来到学校。

Her friend, Anna, offered to exchange her set of markers for the brand-new pencils.

她的朋友安娜提出用自己的一套马克笔交换这些崭新的铅笔。

Elia agreed, but soon discovered that the markers were dried up.

艾莉亚同意了，但很快发现马克笔已经干涸。

"That’s not fair!" cried Elia to her teacher. "I want my new pencils back."

“这不公平！”艾莉亚哭着对老师说，“我想要回我的新铅笔。”

After some tears and negotiation, the teacher helped the girls set things right by returning the items to their original owners.

经过泪水和协商，老师帮助女孩们物归原主。

Later that day, at story time, the teacher shared the picture book classic 

当天稍晚的故事时间，老师分享了经典绘本《弗朗西丝的公平交易》。

Though the conflict in the story is just over a broken tea set, the message about fair play was not lost on the children.

尽管故事冲突仅围绕破损茶具展开，但关于公平竞赛的启示却深深触动了孩子们。

The book was helpful in exploring a small, yet significant, life lesson.

这个绘本为探索生活中微小却重要的人生课程提供了有效途径。

Stories are vital to the way we process and experience life events and the feelings that surround us.

故事对于人类处理生活事件及情感体验具有至关重要的作用。

The ability to create, share, and respond to stories is one of the vital characteristics of being human.

创造、分享和回应故事的能力，是人类区别于其他生物的核心特征之一。

In fact, the human brain is programmed to see patterns and become fascinated in the plot development of stories, finally storing them in long-term memory.

事实上，人类大脑天生具有识别模式的特质，会对故事情节发展产生浓厚兴趣，最终将其存入长期记忆。

As a result, the brain is a remarkably effective processor of stories, both real and fictional.

因此，大脑成为处理现实与虚构故事的卓越处理器。

High-quality picture books are a good blend of art and literature that attracts kids’ imagination and communicates an idea in an effective way.

优质绘本作为艺术与文学的完美结合，既能激发儿童想象力，又能有效传递理念。

These books are perfect teaching tools, as they deal with the powerful emotions that kids feel, model effective coping strategies, and present complex concepts in appropriate ways.

这些书籍堪称理想的教学工具：它们处理儿童面临的强烈情感，示范有效的应对策略，并以适龄方式呈现复杂概念。

In addition, according to brain research, the picture book complements words with what leaves the most permanent impression: images.

脑科学研究还表明，绘本通过图像这种最持久的记忆载体，为文字提供补充。

The pictures in books are distinctive from the fleeting images kids see on television in that they remain on the page, ready to be revisited, touched, and commented upon.

与电视转瞬即逝的画面不同，书页上的插图可供反复观赏、触摸和讨论。

Whether we share stories about families, historical events, or emotions, stories are a way to sum up life’s memorable moments and lasting lessons.

无论是家庭轶事、历史事件还是情感教育，故事都是凝聚生命难忘时刻与永恒教诲的载体。

We can control the power of literature and use it to develop positive character in young kids by reading often, choosing suitable books, and enjoying stories together.

通过经常阅读、精选适龄读物和共享阅读乐趣，我们能够掌控文学的力量，以此培养幼儿的积极品格。

We have heard a lot about the health benefits of tea, especially green tea.

关于茶的健康益处，尤其是绿茶，我们已经听过很多。

It is high in polyphenols, compounds with strong antioxidant activity that in test-tube and animal models show anticancer and heart-protective effects.

绿茶富含多酚类化合物，这种强抗氧化剂在试管实验和动物实验中显示出抗癌和保护心脏的作用。

Good clinical studies are few, however, and although physicians tell their patients to drink green tea, there hasn’t been any definite proof of the value of that advice.

然而严谨的临床研究却很少，尽管医生会建议病人饮用绿茶，但这一建议始终缺乏确凿的科学依据。

A team of Japanese researchers was able to link green tea consumption with decreased mortality from many causes—including heart disease.

日本研究团队发现绿茶摄入量与多种病因（包括心脏病）导致的死亡率下降存在关联。

The researchers tracked 40,530 healthy adults ages 40 to 79 in a region of northeastern Japan where most people drink green tea, following them for up to 11 years.

研究人员对日本东北部地区40,530名40-79岁健康成年人进行了长达11年的跟踪调查，该地区居民普遍有饮用绿茶的习惯。

Those who drank five or more cups of green tea a day had significantly lower mortality rates than those who drank less than one cup a day.

数据显示：每日饮用五杯以上绿茶的人群总死亡率显著低于每日饮用不足一杯者。

There were also fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease.

心血管疾病致死率也相对较低。

But no such association was seen with deaths from cancer.

但绿茶摄入量与癌症死亡率未见相关性。

Nor was consumption of oolong or black tea connected with any decrease in mortality.

且饮用乌龙茶或红茶也未显现出降低死亡率的效应。

Those teas are easier to be combined with oxygen in processing, which not only darkens the color of the leaves and changes their flavor but also reduces their polyphenol content.

乌龙茶和红茶在加工过程中更易氧化，这一过程不仅加深了茶叶色泽、改变风味，还会降低多酚类物质含量。

Coffee is more complicated.

咖啡的健康影响更为复杂。

It has received both gold stars and black marks in medical literature.

在医学文献中既受赞誉也遭质疑。

It, too, contains antioxidants, although they are less well studied than tea polyphenols.

咖啡虽含抗氧化剂，但其研究深度不及茶多酚。

Evidence for the health benefits of coffee is growing, however.

不过支持咖啡健康效益的证据正在积累。

A group of investigators from Finland, Italy and the Netherlands reports that coffee seems to protect against age-related decline in mental capacity.

来自芬兰、意大利和荷兰的研究团队报告显示，咖啡可能具有延缓老年认知衰退的作用。

The scientists studied 676 healthy men born from 1900 to 1920 and followed them for 10 years, using standardized measures of brain function.

科学家们对676名1900-1920年间出生的健康男性进行了为期10年的追踪，采用标准化脑功能检测。

Their conclusion: the men who consumed coffee had significantly less decline in mental capacity than those who didn’t.

研究结论显示：饮用咖啡者认知能力衰退程度显著低于不饮用者。

Three cups a day seemed to provide the most protection.

每日三杯的摄入量显示出最佳保护效果。

Population studies like those help us form assumptions about relationships between dietary habits and long-term health.

此类群体研究帮助我们建立饮食习惯与长期健康关系的假设。

We still have to test our suppositions in controlled conditions, and measure the effects of coffee and tea on various systems of the body.

但仍需通过受控实验验证推测，并系统评估咖啡和茶对人体各机能的影响。
