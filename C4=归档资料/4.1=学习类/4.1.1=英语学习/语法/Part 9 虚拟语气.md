If it rains tomorrow,I will stay at home.

这种表示人的主观愿望、猜测、建议或假设等的句子就成为虚拟语气

如何使用？

虚拟是由句中的谓语变化来体现的，可以用于条件、目的状语从句及宾语从句中。

常见的虚拟语气一般由if引导

# 虚拟语气（if从句）

- 虚拟语气过去时，对现在的假设

- 表达对现在的希望，也就是表达现在无法实现的事情

- 因为虚拟语气过去式，谓语要用过去式

- 主句要有助动词，根据从句的时态，助动词也要用过去式

- would

- If I knew her number,I would call her.

- could

- If I had money,I could buy the car.

- might

- If I were rich,I might go there.

- should

- 以上表达与现在的事实相反称为虚拟语气过去时

- 同类原则

- 从句是过去时，主句也要用过去时

- 如何翻译？

- 时态倒退原则

- 因为过去式是表达对现在的希望，所以翻译时译为现在式

- If I knew her number,I would call her.

- 如果我知道她的电话号码，我现在就会给她打电话

- =As I don't know her number,I don't call her.

- If I had money,I could buy the car.

- =Because I don't have money,I can't buy the car.

- If I were rich,I could go there.

- 虚拟语气中，无论第几人称，be动词的过去式都只用were

- If I were...

- If you were...

- If her/she were...

- 虚拟语气过去完成时，对过去的假设

- 假设过去的事情与现在相反会怎么样

- 从句一般由if引导，谓语应该用过去完成式had+p.p.

- 主句中需有助动词，根据条件状语从句的时态，助动词要用过去完成时态；

- would,could might,should + have + p.p.

- If I had studied hard,I could have passed the test.

- 如果我认真学习，（过去）考试就及格了。

- 意思就是我以前没有努力学习，所以考试没及格。

- =Because I didn't study hard,I couldn't pass the test.

- If I had known her number,I would have called her.

- 如果我知道她的电话号码，（过去）我会给她打电话。

- =As I didn't know her number,I didn't call her.

- If she had helped me,I should have finished it.

- =Beacuse she didn't help me,I didn't finish it.

- If I had got up early,I could have caught the bus.

- =As I didn't get up early,I couldn't catch the bus.

- 以上从句也遵守同类原则，都使用了过去完成时

- 翻译上要翻译成过去时，倒退一个时态

- 错综虚拟语气

- 虚拟语气有时也会不遵守同类原则

- If we had got up earlier,we would be on the train now.

- 从句时虚拟语气过去完成时，主句是虚拟语气现在时

- 翻译为：如果我们早点起床（过去时），我们现在就在火车上了。（现在时）

- 表达出过去发生得事情对现在产生了影响

- If Shrek had married Pricess Fiona,Shrek would be happy now.

- 与同类原则的区别

- 如果想表达对现在有影响的虚拟语气便用错综复杂语气

- 如果想表达对现在没有影响的虚拟语气则使用同类原则

- 要求

- 条件从句中要有if，主句中要有助动词

- if从句中动词用had+p.p，主句要用助动词的过去式（would，could，might，should）

- 句尾有表示现在的副词now，today，like this等。

- 例子

- If the driver had been careful,those people could be alive now.

- If it had not rained a lot,the road whouldn't be so muddy now.

- If I had got some more sleep last night,I wouln't be tired today.

- If I had bought the book last night,I would not regret it like this.

- =As I didn't buy the book last night,I regret it like this.

- 遇到虚拟语气处理办法

- 检测是否符合同类原则

- 翻译句子注意时态

- 如果看到“过去完成时-过去时”的句子，要考虑是不是错综复杂虚拟语气，检查主句的句末是否有now或today等暗示现在有影响的词

- 虚拟语气将来时，对将来的假设和意志

- 表达几率非常小，几乎不可能

- 从句中要有if+should（were to）

- 对将来的一般性预测动词只需用现在式，虚拟语气要表达可能性很少

- 主句已经有了助动词，无法再加助动词，只能再从句加

- 主句中要有助动词will（would）,can(could),may(might)

- 从句要用should时，主句用的will,call,many,shall,表示“万一”的意思

- 例句

- If it should rain tomorrow,the party will not be held tomorrow.

- 万一明天下雨（几率很小），派对将会桥

- If it rains tomorrow,the party will not be hold tomorrow

- 不用虚拟语气时，这个概率为50%

- If I were to be born again,I would marry you.

- 如果我重生的话，我会和你结婚

- If it should rain tomorrow,I will stay at home.

- If he should die,I would take care of his children.

- If I were to be young again,I would marry you.

- If the sun were to rise in the west,I would marry you.

- if+should与if+ were to有什么区别？

- 用should的情况

- 主句中的助动词无论现在时或过去时都可以用（will，would，can，could）

- 不能用过去完成时（should（would等））have + p.p.

- If it should rain tomorrow,I will stay at home.

- If he should die,I would take care of his children.

- 用were to的情况

- 主句中的助动词只能用过去式（would,could,might,should).不能用现在式或过去完成式

- If the sun were to rise in the west,I would change my mind to love you forever.

- 避免混淆

- If it rains tomorrow,I will stay at home.

- 表示下雨几率50%

- If it should rain tomorrow,I will(would) stay at home.

- 表示现在炎炎夏日，不太可能下雨

- If if were to rain tomorrow,I would stay at home.

- 表示在沙漠里，一百多年没下过雨，几率为0%

- 省略if的情况

- 省略时主语和谓语要倒装

- If he had known the answer,he would have told me.

- =Had he known the answer,he would have told me.

- If I were rich,I could go there.

- =Were I rich,I could go there.
