英语中重要词类：名词（代词）、动词、形容词、副词

名词：主宾补，动词：谓语，形容词修饰名词（代词），副词修饰形副动句

- 名词

- 普通名词

- 动名词

- 动词不定式的名词性用法

- 包含主语和谓语的名词性从句

- 形容词

- 普通形容词

- 动词不定式的形容词词性用法和分词

- 包含主语和谓语的定语从句

- 副词

- 普通副词

- 动词不定式的副词性用法

- 介词+名词构成的短语

- 包含主语和谓语的状语从句

状语从句例子：

- After I took a shower,I went to bed.

- 我洗澡后去睡觉了，这句话的重点是什么？

- 我睡觉

- 所以“我洗澡后”的作用修饰“我睡觉”

- 主句：我睡觉

- 从句：我洗澡后

状语从句相比于名词性从句和定语从句时，很容易分辨出主句和从句

# 状语从句的种类

- 时间状语从句

- 表示时间的连接词

- when

- When I read a book,I am happy.

- as

- As I got older,I came to understand my parents.

- while

- While you were sleeping,Kevin called you.

- as soon as

- Please call as soon as you ariive.

- after

- before

- till

- 原因状语从句

- 表示原因的连接词

- Because

- Because I was tired,I went to bed early.

- As

- As I didn't know what to do,I asked my mom about it.

- since

- Since we don't have classes,we can go to the theater.

- 让步状语从句

- 表示让步的连接词

- Though

- Though I was tired,I study hard last night.

- Although

- Although he was tired,he got up early this morning.

- while

- While a box is square,a circle is round.

- 条件状语从句

- 表示条件的连接词

- If

- If it is fine tomorrow,we will go on a picnic.

- 属于虚拟语气，也算状语从句的一种，比较复杂

# 状语从句的时态

- 条件状语从句

- If you will turn to the left,you will see the building.

- 错误，条件状语从句不能用将来时要用限制时

- If you turn to the left,you will see the building.

- 如果......，已经包含将来的意思前后两个句子都用将来就显得重复，英语不喜欢重复

- If comes back,I will marry him.

- If it rains tomorrow,I will not go out.

- 时间状语从句

- After I will finish the work,I will go out.

- 错误，删除will

- After I finish the work,I will go out.

- When she comes back,I will tell the truth.

- Please call me as soon as you arrive.

- 容易混淆的点

- 条件状语从句和时间状语从句成为起名词作用的名词性从句或成为修饰名词的定语从句时不能用现在式而要用将来时

- When he comes back,I will leave

- I don't know when he will come back.

- I wonder the time when he will come back.

- 如何区分时间状语从句、条件状语从句和表示时间、条件的名词性从句

- I will tell the truth when she comes back.

- 移除掉状语从句后，句子仍完整

- I will tell the truth.

- Please tell me when she will come back.

- 去掉状语从句后，句子不完成，缺少宾补，

- 所以是名词性从句，when引导的从句要使用将来时

# 伴随状语

1. 通过上下文可以理解意思时，可以省略引导状语从句的连词

1. 状语主句中的主语和主句的主语相同时，可以省略状语从句的主语

1. 再省略连词和主语时，谓避免引起歧义，状语从句的谓语要变成分词

- Feeling tried,I went to bed early.

- Feeling tried就是伴随状语，说明主句原因，表示原因的伴随状语

- Because I felt tired,I went to bed early.

- 去掉连词->去掉主语->动词变形

- When she saw the dog,she ran off.

- 省略连词

- when she saw the dog,she ran off.

- 从句和主句的主语相同，去掉

- she saw the dog,she ran off.

- 谓语变现在分词

- Seeing the dog,she ran off.

- After he finished his homework,he went skating.

- Finishing his homework,he went skating.

- As she was sick,she went to bed early.原因

- Being sick,she went to bed early.

- 状语从句中的事件比主句中的事件发生得早

- 从句是过去时或过去完成时，主句是现在时或过去时，动词不能变现在分词而是用having+p.p.
