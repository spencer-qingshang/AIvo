a friend who lives in Seoul.

这种包含主语和谓语、起修饰名词的句子就叫定语从句。

我去学校了

我去学校旁边的餐厅了。

我在餐厅吃饭了。

很好吃。

变成一句话：我去学校旁边的餐厅吃饭了，很好吃。

英语中将两个句子合成一个句子，在两个句子中间起连接作用的就是关系代词。

# 关系代词who

This is the man.

He helped me yesterday.

- This is the man he helped me yesterday.

- 错误，这样连接会有两个主语This,he以及两个谓语is,helped

- 可以加上and,This is the man and he helped me yesterday.

- 这样表述正确，但是不够简洁，可以用who代表 and he.

- This is the man who helped me yesterday.

- who同时起he代词作用，也起and连词的作用

- the man则是被定语从句修饰的先行词

- She is a girl who cooks well.

- 主格关系代词

- This is the girl who played the piano.

- She is a girl.

- She cooks well.

- Do you know the girl who played the piano?

- 句子的主语时人是，无论性别，都使用主格关系代词是who.

- 当主语时第三人称单数是，后面的动词要+s

- I have an uncle who lives in Busan.

- 所有格关系代词

| 主格 | 所有格 | 宾格 | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 第一人称 | I/we | my/our | me/us | 
| 第二人称 | you | your | you | 
| 第三人称 | he / she / they | his / her / their | him / her / them | 


- I have a friend and her name is Alice.

- I have a friend whose name is Alice.

- 因为关系代词不是代替she而是her，所以用whose引导先行词a friend.

- This is the boy whose father is a doctor.

- I met a woman whose hunsband is an English teacher.

- whose代替代词所有his/her,所以叫做所有格关系代词

- 如何区分关系代词的主格、宾格和所有格？

- 主格后有谓语，主语+谓语+宾格，这是辨别的一大标准

- The boy whose father is a teacher is my father.

- 这里也是主语+谓语，但是却用所有格

- The boy is my father

- His father is a teacher.

- The boy is my father whose father is a teacher.

- The boy whose father is a teacher is my friend.

- 养成习惯，看到关系代词引导的句子就用括号标注起来

- The boy (whose father is a teacher) is my friend.

- 宾格关系代词

- I love the girl.I met her yesterday.

- I love the girl I met her yesterday.

- 不能直接把两个句子首尾相接。

- 两个句子相同的部分是the girl=her,所以宾格的关系代词是whom,用whom 代替her

- I love the girl I met whom yesterday.

- 错误，关系代词通常位于定语从句前，起引导从句的连词作用

- I love the girl whom I met yesterday.

- 移到the girl先行词的后面才可以连接

- whom可以用who代替

- 如何区分？

- who后面没有主语，而是接谓语，便是主格关系代词

- I have a friend who lives in Japan.

- 后面接主语+谓语，便是宾格关系代词

- Sarah is the girl who I met this morning.（可以用whom代替）

- Do you know the man who Sarah is talking to?(可以用whom代替)

- The lady (whom you met at the station) is my aunt.

- 轻松翻译含有关系代词的定语从句的方法

- 在读句子时判断是否含有关系代词

- 有先行词和关系代词，就可以判断出师定语从句

- 用括号画出先行词后面关系代词引导的定语从句

- This is the girl (who played the piano);

- I met a woman (whose husband is an English teacher);

- Sarah is the girl (whom I met this morning).

- 确定关系代词引导的定语从句是修饰先行词的

- 翻译的顺序是

- 主句的主语

- **这位**

- **我**

- **萨拉**

- 定语从句

- 这位 **演奏钢琴的**

- 我 **她丈夫是英语老师的**

- 萨拉 **我今天早上看到的**

- 先行词

- 这位 演奏钢琴的**女孩**

- 我 她丈夫是英语教师的**女人**

- 萨拉 我今天早上见到的**女孩**

- 最后是主句的谓语

- 这位**是**演奏钢琴的女孩

- 我**见到了**她丈夫是英语教师的女人

- 萨拉**是**我今天早上见到的女孩

- **记住翻译完主句的主语就翻译从句。**

- 主句的主语->定语从句->主句中的先行词->主句的谓语

# 关系代词which

先行词是事物或动物采用which，也分主格、所有格和宾格

|  | 主格 | 所有格 | 宾格 | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 人 | 人称代词 | I / you / he / she / we / they | my / your / his / her / our / their | me / you / him / her / us / them | 
| 关系代词 | who | whose | whom | 
| 事物、动物 | 人称代词 | it/they | its/their | it/them | 
| 关系代词 | which | of which/whose | which | 


- This is the book.

- It is very interesting.

- This is the book it is very interesting.

- 错误，不能直接连起来

- This is the book and it is very interesting.

- 不够简炼

- This is the book who is very interesting.

- 错误，先行词是人才能用who

- This is the book which is very interesting.

- 用which代替and it.

- 主格关系代词

- 先行词是事物

- The is the letter which arrived yesterday.

- 先行词是动物

- This is the cat which has blue eyes.

- 所有格关系代词

- 先行词是事物

- This is the table whose leg was broken yesterday.

- 可以用of which代替whose

- I love the cat whose hair is black.

- of which the hair.(必须加the)

- the hair of which.

- This is the table whose leg was broken yesterday.

- of which the leg.

- the leg of which.

- 先行词是动物

- I love the cat whose hair is black.

- 宾格关系代词

- This is the car which I bought yesterday.

- I know the song which you like.

- The fish is still alive which I caught yesterday.

- The fish which I caught yesterday is still alive.

- 先行词离关系代词太远会不好理解，要紧跟着

- The letter made me cry which he sent to me last week.

- The letter which he sent to me last week made me cry.

- The people whom I saw at the movies are his friends.

# 省略关系代词的情况

- 省略宾格关系代词

- 只有宾格关系代词可以省略，主格关系代词和所有格关系代词不能省略

- 假设省略主格关系单词，I know the man loves you.

- 会与名词性从句冲突，变成了省略that作宾语的名词性从句

- 特殊情况下可以省略主格关系代词

- 如果是主格关系代词+be动词+分词就可以省略主格关系代词+be动词

- 现在分词

- The boy who is standing by the door is my brother.

- The boy standing by the door is my bother.

- 过去分词

- I received a letter which was written in English.

- I received a letter written in English.

- 关系代词+介词和介词+关系代词

- This is the house.I live in it.

- This is the house I live in which.

- 错误，关系代词一定位于定语从句前，先行词后

- This is the house which I live in.

- This is the house which I live in.

- This is the house in which I live.

- This is the desk on which I put my bag.

- 关系代词前有介词时不能省略关系代词，可以把他移动到后面

- This is the desk on I put my bag.

- 错误，不能省略，前面有介词

- This is the desk  I put my bag on.

- 介词放后面，就可以省略关系代词.

# 关系代词that

- **掌握关系代词that的概念**

- 除了所有格外，先行词是人或事物都可以用that

- I have an uncle who lives in Busan.

- I have an uncle that lives in Busan.

- This is the watch which was made in Korea.

- This is the watch that was made in Korea.

- This is the singer whom I wanted to see.

- This is the singer that I wanted to see.

- This is the toy which he plays with.

- This is the toy that he plays with.

- I have a friend whose mother speaks English.

- I have a friend that mother speaks English.

- 错误，不能用that代替所有格

- Look at the mountain whose top is covered with snow.

- Look at the mountain that top is covered with snow.

- 错误，不能代替所有格（事物）

- This is the house in which I live.

- This is the that I live.

- 错误，前面有介词不能用that

- **只能用关系代词that的情况**

- **先行词是人+事物或人+动物**

- Look at the girl and her dog that are running.

- **先行词是the+最高级或the+序数词**

- She is the tallest girl that I have ever seem.

- Jane is the first girl that came to school.

- **先行词中有all,every,some,any,no**

- Everyone that goes to church looks happy.

- All that glitters is not gold.

- **先行词有the very,the same,the only**

- This is the very watch that I lost yesterday.

- This is the same watch that I lost yesterday.

- **先行词中有疑问代词who,which**

- Who that knows him will trust him?

- Which of the movies that you watched this year is the best?

- **名词性从句that&关系代词that**

- 引导名词性从句的that

- It is true that Shrek married Princess Fiona.

- 引导定语从句的that

- This is Shrek that married Princess Fiona.

- 区分两种that的方法

- 方法一

- 先用括号画出从句

- It is true (that Shrek married Princess Fiona).

- It is true (that I helped him yesterday).

- This is Shrek (that married Princess Fiona).

- This is the very watch (that I lost yesterday).

- 判断括号里的句子是否完整的拥有主谓宾结构，如果有则是名词性从句，否则是定语从句

- 方法二

- 判断that前面有没有先行词，有则是定语从句否则是名词性从句

- **关系代词的一致**

- **先行词决定关系代词后的谓语动词是单数还是复数**

- **be动词**

- Look at the girl who is dancing in the street.

- Look at the girl.She is dancing in the street.

- the girl时单数，所以谓语动词应该用is

- Look at the many girl who are dancing in the street.

- Look at the many girls.They are dancing in the street.

- many girls是复数，所以主格关系代词后的谓语动词应该用are.

- **实义动词**

- I know a girl who lives in L.A.

- I know a girl.She lives in L.A.

- a girl是单数，所以用lives

- I know many girls who live in L.A.

- I know many girls.They live in L.A.

- many girls是复数，所以用live

# **what代替先行词+关系代词**

- I understand the thing.You said it(the thing).

- I understand the thing and you said it.

- 不够简炼

- I understand the thing you said which.

- 不能把which放在句尾

- I understand the thing which you said.

- =I understand what you sid.

- waht代替the thing which

- 先行词+关系代词=what

- the thing + which

- I heard the thing which happened yesterday.

- I heard what happened yesterday.

- something that

- anything that

- all that

- what本身包含了先行词可以使句子变得精炼，有很多习惯用法

- what I am/what I was.

- 现在的我、过去的我

- I am not what I was

- what he has/what he had

- 他现在的财产/他过去的财产

- what is called/what we call

- 所谓的 = so called

- what is worse

- 雪上加霜

- = to make matters worse

- what is better

- 更好的

- what is more

- 而且=moreover,in addition

- what is the best of all

- 最好的

# 限定性从句与非限定性定语从句

- 限定性定语从句和非限定性定语从句

- 区别

- 删除定语从句后对主句句意产生影响则是限定性否则是非限定性

- He has two sons who became doctors.

- who引导的定语从句修饰two sons，起限定作用

- 加上逗号就可以删

- He has two sons,who became doctors.

- She has a phone which doesn't work.

- She has a phone,which doesn't work.

- =She has a phone but it doesn't work.

- 连词+代词可以替换关系代词

- 关系代词前有没有逗号会是两个意思

- I will not wear the clothes,which will distinguish me from my fellows.

- I wii not wear the clothes which will distinguish me from my fellows.

- 我不会穿把我和朋友们分开的衣服的。

- 加上逗号后变成了：我不会穿衣服的，不穿衣服会把我和朋友们区别开。

- 无法用关系代词that代替的情况

- She had two daughers,that became lawyers

- 关系代词是非限定性定语从句时不能用that代替

- 关系代词前有逗号无论主格还是宾格都不能用that

-
