Here’s one for your diary.

记得将这一天标记在你的日历上。

Friday, February 25 is the day in 2005 when the TUC estimates that people who do unpaid overtime will stop working for free and start to get paid.

2005年2月25日，星期五，这一天TUC（英国工会大会）预计那些无偿加班的人将停止免费工作，并开始获得应有的报酬。

The TUC is urging people who do unpaid overtime to "work your proper hours" on that day, taking a proper lunch-break, and arriving and leaving work on time.

TUC呼吁无偿加班的员工在这一天“按时工作”，合理安排午休，按时上下班。

This should remind Britain’s employers just how much they depend on the goodwill and voluntary extra work of their staff, the TUC says.

TUC表示，这一天旨在提醒英国的雇主，他们在多大程度上依赖员工的善意和自愿额外付出。

Indeed the TUC is urging Britain’s bosses to take their staff out for lunch, coffee or a cocktail on "work your proper hours day" to say thank you for their hard work and commitment.

事实上，TUC还呼吁英国的老板们在“按时工作日”带员工外出聚餐、喝咖啡或享用鸡尾酒，以表达对员工辛勤工作和奉献精神的感谢。

"This will be an annual event," said TUC head of campaigns, Nigel Stanley.

“这将成为一个年度活动，”TUC活动负责人奈杰尔·斯坦利（Nigel Stanley）表示。

"Every so often even people who love their jobs and are happy to put in extra hours want to be told they are not taken for granted.

“即使是那些热爱工作并乐于加班的人，也希望听到他们的付出没有被忽视。

And if it makes people and employers think a bit harder about organizing a better work-life balance, so much the better."

如果这能促使员工和雇主更加认真地思考如何实现更好的工作与生活平衡，那就再好不过了。”

I think it is easy to get the idea from the media that, except in unusual cases, everyone works from nine in the morning to five in the evening, five days a week, in an office or plant of some kind.

我认为从媒体中很容易得到这样的印象，除了少数特殊情况外，每个人都在某种办公室或工厂里，每周五天，从早上九点工作到下午五点。

Yes. In the stereotyped view of the job, there's a set time to start work, another to stop.

是的。在对工作的传统刻板印象中，工作有固定的开始和结束时间。

But the examination of the work force, however, shows a great variety in work schedules and sites.

然而，深入观察劳动力情况会发现，工作时间和地点非常多样化。

Although Nine-to-five is generally thought of as the work day, many jobs are performed when Nine-to-five personnel are off the job.

尽管“朝九晚五”通常被认为是典型的工作时间，但许多工作实际上是在“朝九晚五”的工作人员下班后完成的。

Most jobs, for example, in the entertainment industry are performed in off hours.

例如，娱乐行业的大部分工作都是在非正常工作时间进行的。

That's right. Monday through Friday is referred to as the work week.

没错。从周一到周五被称为工作周。

Still, many people do not work each and every weekday or during the five-day week exclusively.

然而，许多人并不是每天都在工作日工作，也不完全局限于这五天的工作周。

And alternating shifts at stores and hospitals, for example, often have personnel working odd days.

比如，在商店和医院的轮班工作中，员工往往需要在非传统的日子上班。

Many people work over the weekend, keeping stores and services in operation.

许多人在周末工作，以维持商店和服务的正常运转。

Sunday and holiday work has its good side - time-and-a-half or double-time pay rates in some businesses.

而且，在一些行业，周日和节假日工作的报酬更高——比如1.5倍工资甚至双倍工资。

**Business-connected social life is often a real concern for a person in private enterprises.**

与业务相关的社交生活往往是私人企业中员工关注的重要问题。

**As an employee progresses in a particular company, it may account for a great deal of the social life for him and, if he is married, his wife.**

随着员工在公司中的职位逐步提升，这种社交活动可能会占据他很大一部分的生活重心，如果他已婚，这也可能包括他的配偶。

**This kind of social life is, for some people, an important part of the job.**

对于某些人来说，这类社交生活是工作中不可或缺的一部分。

**For younger or newer employees, low on the organization chart, business-connected social life is normally limited to attending office parties.**

对于职位较低或刚入职的员工来说，与业务相关的社交活动通常仅限于参加办公室聚会。

**They might be asked to dinner or a Christmas party at the boss' house, but they are not expected to return the invitation.**

他们或许会被邀请参加老板家中的晚宴或圣诞派对，但并不需要回请对方。

**It is often said that more business is done during social events than at the office.**

人们常说，在社交场合完成的业务往往比在办公室中完成的还要多。

**For example, the business lunch is the standard combination of business and pleasure, during which serious matters are discussed over wine and contracts signed between the entrée and dessert.**

例如，商务午餐是将商业与娱乐结合的经典形式，在这种场合，重要事务可能会在饮酒时讨论，而合同则可能在主菜与甜点之间签署。

**Anniversary dinners and benefits are, in the same way, occasions at which business can continue after office hours.**

周年晚宴和福利活动同样是工作时间以外继续洽谈业务的良机。

**Conventions provide the opportunity for several days or more of new contacts and discussions, interrupted only by speeches and registrations.**

各种会议和行业大会则提供了数天甚至更长时间的机会，用于建立新的人脉和深入讨论，仅会被演讲和登记流程短暂打断。
